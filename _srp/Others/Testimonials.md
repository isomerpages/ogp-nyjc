The NUS Science Research Programme (SRP) is definitely one of the top highlights of my first year in JC. I have always found research to be inspirational and was inclined to try it out, but there were no opportunities available earlier. Thus, I am grateful for being able to finally gain some research experience through the SRP.

My interest lies in topics related to health issues in general. Hence when deciding the research topic, I knew I wanted to work on something linked to solving health issues. The focus of the project I was working on with my SRP partner, was the suppression of amyloid fibril formation which can occur in the brain. However, things did not turn out as well as thought and we did not manage to achieve very promising results. As we continued to soldier on to find the breakthrough, we encountered a formulation that resulted in a gel-like consistency, which we later identified as a hydrogel. This was the turning point - our research focus pivoted towards the formation of hydrogels for the application of wound-healing. The unexpected change of the research focus, two months into the programme, presented a significant learning point for me: while perseverance is important when met with hurdles, we should also be open to opportunities that present themselves in the process.

Although I am not entirely sure of the specific aspect of research I wish to embark on in the future, the programme has most definitely solidified my passion in research. The programme took quite a lot of time and energy to complete, and I admit that it was challenging trying to balance schoolwork, extra-curricular commitments and the programme. It took some time to adjust, but eventually I was able to schedule all my commitments properly every day and dedicate enough time to each commitment.

Overall, the programme has made my JC 1 year an enriching and rewarding one.

During my JC1 December holidays, I had the opportunity to attend a 1-month internship at Defence Science Organisation (DSO) National Laboratories as part of the DSTA Junior College Scholarship. I was assigned to work on an Artificial Intelligence (AI) project and over the course of the project, I learnt many new AI-related concepts. The internship experience also enabled me to further hone my skills in the Python programming language. While the experience was a highly memorable one, things were not always smooth sailing and there were certainly some obstacles faced. For example, as this was my first time working on a project like this, I lacked the experience in using the given AI framework and found it difficult at the beginning to debug some of the code. In order to overcome this, I had to quickly pick up important concepts and this is where I am grateful to have had helpful and friendly mentors. Through constantly asking questions and learning from my mentors, I managed to pick up the new concepts quickly and this helped me to complete my project more efficiently.

Overall, I would say my internship at DSO was a fruitful experience which equipped me with new skills and important knowledge about AI that can help me in my future endeavors. Prior to my internship, I was already greatly interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Now, having had hands-on experience dealing with such technology, I am more certain that I want to further my interest at the undergraduate level and hope to have my future career also revolve around AI.

With the advent of the AI revolution, I am thankful that this internship has equipped me with relevant and useful skills to meet the demands of the future.

In 2022, I had the opportunity to take part in a research project with one other teammate under the guidance of a professor from SUTD as part of the Research Mentorship Programme (RMP). This journey is one of my most enriching and memorable experiences in JC1.

The project was about image reconstruction of MRI machines and a part of this project involved using machine learning in different programming languages such as Python, Octave and MATLAB. My lack of experience in coding makes this journey quite challenging at the beginning. However, my mentor who has had numerous experiences in this field guided us closely throughout the journey, enabling me to learn the skills of coding and machine learning. He also provided us with advice on the next steps to take to learn these skills and pointed us to relevant resources which aided us in our learning.

It was challenging to juggle between schoolwork, CCA and other commitments. However, taking part in this research project has taught me the importance of good time management and early preparation for various things such as the gathering of resources and revision material for upcoming exams, research updates, etc.

Overall, this invaluable opportunity has allowed me to learn so many new things and has helped me gain essential skills that would be beneficial for me in the future!

In November, I had the opportunity to conduct research on a silver-based fibre. I took up this program as I had some interest in the workings of materials and was unsure of whether material science and engineering would be a good fit for me in university.

In the lab, the experiments I conducted revolved around the synthesis of the fibre, and the exploration of its properties using various machines such as an electron microscope. The analysis of the fibre under the electron microscope was actually the most memorable part of my research as I was able to see the changes we made to the fibre physically and not through experimentation of its properties.

Although balancing research, academics and CCA was initially a concern, my mentor understood that this program was more geared towards exposing us to various faculties and gave us a free and easy schedule. Thus, with the prioritisation of work according to deadlines, the balancing of these commitments was actually quite manageable.

From this program, my main takeaway was that I do enjoy material science and engineering but beyond that, it gave me a clearer idea of what I may not enjoy which can help shape my other choices. For example, I was involved in significant amounts of data processing in this program which was honestly quite mundane to me and hence I may not choose courses that are more analytical in nature for university. Overall, participating in this research has helped to shape my perspective on labwork and I strongly encourage research for students who are unsure of what they wish to pursue as research will help open their perspectives (provided that one is not struggling with academics).

In 2021, I had the opportunity to conduct a research under the guidance of a researcher from the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), together with two other teammates. This has been one of my most memorable experiences in JC1.

With some previous experience on programming and having taken a course on machine learning (of course, neither were compulsory, as you will be well-equipped soon after the research begins), I was very glad to find this programme that allowed me to work on something that I am passionate about.  Eager to have a hands-on experience doing a real scientific research, I did not hesitate to sign up.

The research we were offered included using machine learning to categorise regions in Singapore, in order to draw a connection between public transport passenger volume data and land use compositions of these regions. This is indeed a niche and challenging direction in the field, and it is not surprising that our research did not go smoothly all the time.

However, we were lucky to be mentored by our researcher, who himself is doing research in this field. We were able to approach our mentor whenever we met difficulties, and he would always provide valuable advice. In the interim, we developed our ability to solve problems independently and learned to value not only the results but also the process – both were important takeaways from our project. There were times that we seemed to have come to dead ends but by reading past research papers, testing new methods and occasionally changing our approach while not losing hope, we eventually managed to complete this rewarding journey.

Having a research project alongside with curriculum subjects, activities in my CCA, SIGs and other competitions required a rather delicate balance. It is vital to bear in mind the long-term vision for our education and career, and carefully manage conflicts between different commitments. Meanwhile, it really helped a lot that my teachers have been very flexible with tutorials and assignments so that I was never under too much pressure.

The Scientist-in-School programme taught me many things I could not have learned in theories. For example, starting with advanced methods may not always be a good choice due to various restrictions regarding the data, and real-life data does not guarantee meaningful outcome like the ones I would get in a Kaggle contest. These are part of a precious experience that helps me understand more about what it is like to be a data scientist. Of course, you may choose a very different subject to research on but I am sure your experience will be no less rewarding.

So, if you have a research programme in mind, go for it. Find out about a new field, take up new skills, build up friendships and most importantly. Have fun!

During my JC1 December holidays, I was given the opportunity to take part in a five-week research attachment at the Advanced Remanufacturing & Technology Centre (ARTC) – a valuable experience offered as part of the A\*STAR Science Award.

Under the guidance of Dr Wang Weili at ARTC, my research project involved manually programming an Intel depth camera to detect objects in a 3D space. This naturally entailed that I had to learn basic Python programming in order to maximise the camera’s functionality, making use of interesting tools such as machine learning databases and 3D Point Cloud analysis software to identify and construct 3D models of objects, as well as measure their dimensions.

The most memorable – albeit challenging – part of my research attachment was learning how to write code from scratch. Given my complete lack of experience with coding, learning the basics of Python programming and applying them to my research project proved to be an obstacle that I had difficulty overcoming. Nonetheless, with the guidance of my mentor who was with me every step of the way, I was able to learn many new skills related to coding and programming. As someone who is interested in pursuing computer engineering in university, this experience has proven to be very insightful and has fuelled my interest even further.

I must admit that juggling my academic preparations for the JC2 Common Test, my strenuous weekly Dragon Boat training at Singapore Sports Hub as well as the designation of time to conduct research for the project was no easy feat. However, in retrospect, it has taught me the importance of having proper time management as well as pushed the limits of my mental resilience – both of which have benefitted me immensely.

Overall, the programme has proven to be a fun and challenging experience for me and I am sure anyone with the drive to stretch themselves in the field of scientific research would enjoy it as much as I did.

I have always wanted to pursue a career in the Sciences, however I was unsure of the specific course or what exactly interests me. The experience of taking on project that encompassed material science and food science as part of the NUS Science Research Programme, I was exposed to the inter-disciplinary nature of research and found myself drawn to it.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to go to the lab until mid-November. I learnt how to adapt with the guidance of my mentor and adjusted the project to one that can be partially conducted at home. Through the Research Methods Module (RMM) and the research project, I have learnt various data collection and organisational methods and lab-related skills that I would have otherwise not known.

l was initially concerned about the workload and the impact on my school work, however, by reading up on my research topic consistently, I was able to spend sufficient time on both areas, without compromising on my social life.

I am extremely thankful for this learning experience. The programme allows me to apply what I have learnt in school, as well as to give me an introduction to Science research at the tertiary level.

In 2021, I was given a chance to participate in the Nanyang Research Programme (NRP). The Covid19 pandemic has renewed my belief in the crucial role that a medical scientist plays in society. NRP gave me the perfect opportunity to learn more about the scope of the scientist’s work.

The project gave me a glimpse of what it is like to work in pharmaceutical research. I have learned about the traditional methods of producing tablets, as well as novel approaches of manufacturing drug nanoparticles. I have also performed a life-cycle assessment to evaluate environmental sustainability of pharmaceutics production.

Probably the most rewarding part of my research was getting to understand new complex concepts like the Noyese-Whitney equation or nanoparticle stabilisers. I embarked on this journey knowing little to nothing about the topic of my project. In the very first article I read about drug nanocrystals, the opening sentence already contained five unknown words. This brought me to the brink of despair, and for a moment, I even regretted signing up for the research programme. However, the many nights I spent doing literature review were fully rewarded after I managed to get my first experimental results.

Looking back, the NRP was one of my most significant experiences in JC1. Even though pharmaceuticals may not necessarily be my first career choice in future, I now know for sure that I want to dedicate my life to scientific research.

During the attachment, I studied the effects of corrosion on carbon steel by bacteria. I find this attachment insightful as I have not only learnt how to apply one’s knowledge of corrosion to the experiments conducted, but also the application of such knowledge in real life situations. One such example is the prevention of microorganisms from interacting with metal infrastructure and causing corrosion, which has had detrimental effects on our economy as the cost of repairing the damage done is high.

One memorable aspect of this attachment is working with my mentor. He patiently explained the steps of the experiments, from setting up the equipment to analysing and recording the results. Through his guidance and mentorship, I have not only understood the thought process of conducting experiments to obtain the results one is aiming for, but also learnt how to work with others. The aspect of being mentored has strengthened my enthusiasm to learn and motivated me to continue having an open mind and trying out new activities which could enrich my learning. Before this programme, I thought that this career path would be dry and very math-heavy. However, after attending a few sessions, I found out that studying material science can be interesting as there are many aspects and real world applications associated with it.

Overall, this attachment was very interesting and insightful, especially for people who are keen to learn and are open to trying out new things. I have learnt important soft skills such as critical thinking, application of my knowledge in the real world and have good time management. I believe that one can benefit and learn from this programme, regardless of whether one aims to pursue material science as a career in the future. Therefore, I would recommend this attachment programme to my juniors in order to enrich their learning and occupy their time more meaningfully during the holidays.

My SRP research journey is one of the toughest yet most rewarding and enriching parts of my NY Experience so far. I had to brainstorm and propose a research project, and this involved reading up on topics that were beyond the JC syllabus. My hard work paid off when I managed to secure a mentorship at A\*STAR, studying cancer and inflammation. Due to COVID-19-related restrictions in the earlier part of the year, the usual lab-based experiments were not possible. Fortunately, as the situation eased in Phase 3, I was given the opportunity to take up a research attachment at my mentor’s lab at A\*STAR research institute.

The research attachment gave me the invaluable opportunity of experiencing how modern day research is conducted, and the daily work life of a researcher. I learnt basic molecular techniques such as cell culture basics, plasmid extraction, cryopreservation using liquid nitrogen, etc., and had the chance to operate high-tech equipment at the lab, all done under the watchful eye of my mentor, of course.

The initial excitement of entering the lab may quickly die off, and will be replaced with the extended hours of repetitive experimental procedures, waiting for results, reading up articles and writing reports which can be mundane and daunting if one does not have the passion and interest. So far, my research experience has affirmed my belief that biomedical research is the right career choice for me and I hope to become a clinical researcher conducting clinical trials of novel therapies that can potentially save lives.

Last year, I was awarded the A\*STAR Science Award (JC). Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the attachment opportunities at A\*STAR were cancelled. Fortunately, the situation eased in the second part of the year, and I had the opportunity to do a 5-week research attachment at Genome Institute of Singapore during the year-end school holidays.

Besides the exciting experience of working in a research lab, I had the chance to meet people of diverse backgrounds. I got to talk to research mentors who were studying for their PhDs, university students and polytechnic students who were in the midst of completing their final-year project. The advice they gave was truly useful and informative to help me decide on my future university courses and career choices.

I was anxious about juggling my commitments while working throughout the December holidays. However, I found out that all it took was good time management and sufficient preparation done prior to the attachment. Any spare time I had in the office could be used to finish my schoolwork, revise, or take a break.

There was no doubt that the attachment has made my December holidays one of the most meaningful yet. The values, connections and knowledge I acquired would truly be beneficial to me in the years ahead.

When I first entered NYJC, I did not know which career path was best for me and I was unsure on what to do in the future: Engineering? Medicine? Research? I was clueless. By taking part in the Nanyang Research Programme (NRP), it allowed me to assess whether research was a viable career for me. This, along with my interest in the environment, chemistry and engineering, formed the basis for my decision in choosing to take part in an environmental engineering project in NRP.

The most memorable part of NRP was going to Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) research labs, where my research partner and I conducted experiments and collected data for our project. This was my favourite part of NRP as it was hands-on and fun. We also wrote research reports by reviewing articles online. Collecting data and writing reports took up a significant portion of time that I could have spent on leisure activities. When I felt like giving up, I pushed myself and persevered. Eventually, by managing my time properly and prioritising the more important tasks, I was able to juggle easily between my floorball CCA, academics and NRP. If you are a J1 considering taking part in NRP, know that the tangible and intangible skills you will eventually learn are long lasting ones that can be applied in your daily lives.

In 2020, I had the privilege to be part of A\*STAR Scientist-in-School Programme, working with my schoolmate Carmen Lim and our mentor Mr. Zheng Yang Chin from A\*STAR's Institute for Infocomm Research. Our project aims to investigate changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) scalp brain signals during mental arithmetic under varying conditions.

Throughout the duration of the programme, we had meetings with our mentor over Zoom regularly to learn new skills, review literature and discuss research plans. I had picked up many important and interesting skills like coding through Python, signal processing and elementary machine learning. The programme allowed me to apply information I had learnt in my classes, like statistics and linear algebra, to real-life applications.

Importantly, it was an opportunity for me to explore an area of interest of mine, which is computer science. The programme gave me a deeper understanding and appreciation of computer science and gave me a glimpse into what computer science is like at the university level and beyond.

The most memorable experience during my research attachment was visiting Mr. Chin at the Institute for Infocomm Research at Fusionopolis. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, it was difficult for us to meet our mentor out of college in the initial stage. Fortunately, during our December holidays, the restrictions were eased. During the meeting, we discussed our research plans and learned how to operate the EEG machine. We also had the chance to explore the A\*STAR’s Institute for Infocomm Research.

The programme took up a significant amount time and was taxing but what I learnt from the programme was definitely worth it! My mentor was understanding of my CCA commitments (Student Council) and school work, giving my partner and me sufficient time to revise for our examinations. Balancing my other commitments with the programme was difficult but manageable through proper planning and scheduling.

This programme has been a wonderful experience and has allowed me to learn so much!

I was given the opportunity of research attachment at A\*STAR research institute for my JC1 academic year. With two schoolmates, we worked under the guidance of a researcher from the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC). The whole experience was very challenging yet rewarding.

We chose to work on the topic of applying computer vision techniques in the field of material science. We had to quickly familiarise ourselves with many computer vision techniques that we had never heard of previously. Looking back at the entire learning process, the most valuable part were the skills I picked up. Although I had some prior experience with Python, it is only through this research experience that I became comfortable with using Python to solve scientific problems, a skill truly invaluable for anyone interested in STEM-related areas.

The process of literature review, coming up with a hypothesis, writing our own research paper and presenting it in front of others is something vastly different from the JC curriculum, but something that is of immense importance.  It gives us a glimpse of research at the undergraduate level. This experience has allowed me to see how challenging it is to contribute to academia and how rewarding the results can be.

The team participated in an international competition (ST Yau High School Science Award) and we had to spend many nights refining our report and rehearsing our presentation as the deadline was in September which coincided with the busy Term 3. Things got slightly exhausting when my preparation for Physics Olympiad coincided with that for the Yau Award, but I managed to pull both of them off eventually. Looking back at that period of time, I would say it requires a lot of dedication to do well in the research project, definitely no less than the effort one should put in to excel in school subjects.

In short, I would recommend anyone who can manage JC schoolwork to try out a research project. It gives you a taste of working in the scientific community and allows you to pick up many important skills for your future academics and career.

I had the opportunity for a 1-month research attachment at A\*STAR, Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) in the December holidays last year where I had a chance to design an artificial intelligence software to detect lesions in medical scans.

One of my most memorable experiences was visiting A\*STAR research institute with my fellow group members to utilize the more advanced equipment. Fortunately, both my team members were very patient in teaching me how some of the more technical computing aspects function, as I was not as proficient in computing as both of them. Going to A\*STAR also allowed us to meet up in person with our supervisor, Dr. Huang, to ensure that we were on the right track through meetings and discussions.

This attachment helped solidify my decision that research is the right path for me, albeit not in this particular sector, as the collaboration required and excitement from making progress are some of the aspects a research career can offer, both of which I find intriguing. Apart from the raw technical skills, a key takeaway for me was to not feel intimidated from seeking advice or help as if it weren’t for our mentors' guidance, it would have been extremely challenging to complete our objective since all the required expertise is extremely advanced.

Although the attachment was very rewarding, it was still challenging as I had to juggle academics and other commitments at the same time. Thus, I had to have good time management and consistency in my work - not just during the holidays, but across the whole year to cope with all these activities.

As a proud Science Research Programme (SRP) participant, I am always eager to share my experience whenever someone asks me about my time there. My field of research was on Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning. As I had only dealt with basic programming during my lower secondary days, what I had to familiarise myself with for the research were rather niche and foreign. However, my worries were soon dispelled as my mentor was very patient and thorough when guiding me, and was also very forgiving whenever I made mistakes in the initial stages. Gradually, I became more independent in my research. During my time there, I was tasked to take up an online course to understand more about deep learning, and read up on various research papers in order to deepen my understanding. With my new found knowledge, I went on to use the artificial intelligence networks to segment MRI prostate images, and subsequently optimise them such that they achieve higher accuracies. When I witnessed my experiments picking up pace and yielded satisfactory results, my contentment was beyond words and this motivated me to achieve more during the research.

The writing of the actual research paper is, I believe, a part of research that is often overlooked. To produce a thorough research paper, I had to learn how to present my findings in the most comprehensible way, amongst the plethora of diagrams and infographics which I can use. I had to be concise in documenting my whole research as well, so that the readers can, more easily, sieve out and highlight valuable information for themselves. My mentor also imparted a lot of knowledge and tips which were instrumental in my successful completion of the research paper by the stipulated deadline. The end results were indisputably gratifying as I see all my hard work being translated into words and diagrams. Fortunately for me, my mentor has also published an edited version of my research online, and I could share with my close friends and family, a titbit of my understanding gained during the programme.

"Junior College is the last opportunity for me to explore different fields and stretch my academic capabilities before specialising in university!" With that in mind, I embarked on my journey to take up H3 MOE SRP Research project and H3 Chemistry.

Picking a research project was difficult as I felt that most of the topics were very niche. I decided to take on a project that interests me and exposes me to an unfamiliar field and I decided on a project about artificial intelligence and biomedical imaging.

Given that this was my first exposure to computing, I had to be ready to learn a lot of foreign concepts, and that, I found fascinating. My H3 research project started with me attending various Coursera lessons, before learning to conduct visual assessments on PET scans for my data collection. Fortunately, I had a patient professor who was willing to answer my questions and guide me through the research process. Through it, I was able to pick up different knowledge and research skills including data analysis.

I admit that balancing my commitments was difficult, but it was not impossible either! Being intentional to set aside time to relax, strategically planning my time to maximise my efficiency and having a good support system, enabled me to thrive.
