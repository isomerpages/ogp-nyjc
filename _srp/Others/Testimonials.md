<p>From a young age, my ambition has always been geared towards becoming
a researcher. Naturally, I found myself drawn to the Science Research Project
(SRP). This programme provides aspiring researchers like me, the prestigious
opportunity to work with leading researchers in top universities, such
as NUS and NTU on a 6-month long attachment, giving us a taste on the hectic,
yet rewarding and fulfilling life of a researcher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being part of SRP not only exposes us to the challenges of the research
world but also allows us to reap the rewards of our hard work. Interacting
with like-minded individuals from other JCs has been a highlight, fostering
invaluable friendships along the way. On a personal note, navigating through
the lengthy and challenging SRP journey has been a lot of fun for me, especially
when we get to see the fruits of our labour when we participate in competitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SRP really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I strongly encourage
you to sign up, especially if you have keen interest in STEM or research!</p>

<p>I had the privilege of attending the International Science School (ISS),
a two-week programme at the University of Sydney featuring workshops and
lectures spanning all branches of science. As someone inherently curious
with questions that extend beyond our standard curriculum, the experience
was truly eye-opening. Exploring researcher’s breakthroughs was fascinating,
with my favourite revelation being in the realm of quantum computing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quantum computing, a unique fusion of theoretical science (quantum physics)
and contemporary computing, captivated me. It tackles immensely complex
problems that classical computers cannot solve. The application of quantum
computing in cryptography, with its potential to address modern-day cybersecurity
issues, particularly resonated with me as a self-taught programmer, deepening
my interest in computing as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From learning about ongoing research in different fields along with the
process of scientific inquiry, the ISS helped me solidify my passion for
a Computer Science course in university. Not only was it educational, the
programme was also extremely enjoyable. Exploring diverse scientific branches
like marine science and genetic fingerprinting broadened my understanding
and sparked further enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspired by the ISS experience, I decided to take up the academic challenge
of H3 physics to delve deeper into the science I had been learning within
my curriculum. However, perhaps the most impactful aspect of the ISS was
the opportunity to socialise with students from around the world, resulting
in the formation of lifelong friendships.</p>

<p>Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) hosted a 5-day workshop
for Engineering and Tech Programme Scholarship (ETPS) recipients on 15th
of January this year. The workshop featured two parallel tracks: AI robotics
and drone, aimed to equip students with essential engineering skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the AI robotics track, we delved into various aspects, including computer-aided
design (CAD) for designing camera links, programming the robot using AI
to detect humans and animals, robot assembly, and discussions on ethics
and design thinking through the double diamond framework. These skills
culminated in preparing us for the competition held on the final day, which
involved pitching our projects and test-driving the robots equipped with
AI.</p>

<p>The NUS Science Research Programme (SRP) is definitely one of the top
highlights of my first year in JC. I have always found research to be inspirational
and was inclined to try it out, but there were no opportunities available
earlier. Thus, I am grateful for being able to finally gain some research
experience through the SRP.</p>
<p>My interest lies in topics related to health issues in general. Hence
when deciding the research topic, I knew I wanted to work on something
linked to solving health issues. The focus of the project I was working
on with my SRP partner, was the suppression of amyloid fibril formation
which can occur in the brain. However, things did not turn out as well
as thought and we did not manage to achieve very promising results. As
we continued to soldier on to find the breakthrough, we encountered a formulation
that resulted in a gel-like consistency, which we later identified as a
hydrogel. This was the turning point - our research focus pivoted towards
the formation of hydrogels for the application of wound-healing. The unexpected
change of the research focus, two months into the programme, presented
a significant learning point for me: while perseverance is important when
met with hurdles, we should also be open to opportunities that present
themselves in the process.</p>
<p>Although I am not entirely sure of the specific aspect of research I wish
to embark on in the future, the programme has most definitely solidified
my passion in research.&nbsp;The programme took quite a lot of time and
energy to complete, and I admit that it was challenging trying to balance
schoolwork, extra-curricular commitments and the programme. It took some
time to adjust, but eventually I was able to schedule all my commitments
properly every day and dedicate enough time to each commitment.</p>
<p>Overall, the programme has made my JC 1 year an enriching and rewarding
one.</p>

<p>In 2022, I had the opportunity to take part in a research project with
one other teammate under the guidance of a professor from SUTD as part
of the Research Mentorship Programme (RMP). This journey is one of my most
enriching and memorable experiences in JC1.</p>
<p>The project was about image reconstruction of MRI machines and a part
of this project involved using machine learning in different programming
languages such as Python, Octave and MATLAB. My lack of experience in coding
makes this journey quite challenging at the beginning. However, my mentor
who has had numerous experiences in this field guided us closely throughout
the journey, enabling me to learn the skills of coding and machine learning.
He also provided us with advice on the next steps to take to learn these
skills and pointed us to relevant resources which aided us in our learning.</p>
<p>It was challenging to juggle between schoolwork, CCA and other commitments.
However, taking part in this research project has taught me the importance
of good time management and early preparation for various things such as
the gathering of resources and revision material for upcoming exams, research
updates, etc.</p>
<p>Overall, this invaluable opportunity has allowed me to learn so many new
things and has helped me gain essential skills that would be beneficial

<p>In November, I had the opportunity to conduct research on a silver-based
fibre. I took up this program as I had some interest in the workings of
materials and was unsure of whether material science and engineering would
be a good fit for me in university.</p>
<p>In the lab, the experiments I conducted revolved around the synthesis
of the fibre, and the exploration of its properties using various machines
such as an electron microscope. The analysis of the fibre under the electron
microscope was actually the most memorable part of my research as I was
able to see the changes we made to the fibre physically and not through
experimentation of its properties.</p>
<p>Although balancing research, academics and CCA was initially a concern,
my mentor understood that this program was more geared towards exposing
us to various faculties and gave us a free and easy schedule. Thus, with
the prioritisation of work according to deadlines, the balancing of these
commitments was actually quite manageable.</p>
<p>From this program, my main takeaway was that I do enjoy material science
and engineering but beyond that, it gave me a clearer idea of what I may
not enjoy which can help shape my other choices. For example, I was involved
in significant amounts of data processing in this program which was honestly
quite mundane to me and hence I may not choose courses that are more analytical
in nature for university. Overall, participating in this research has helped
to shape my perspective on labwork and I strongly encourage research for
students who are unsure of what they wish to pursue as research will help
open their perspectives (provided that one is not struggling with academics).</p>

<p>In 2021, I had the opportunity to conduct a research under the guidance
of a researcher from the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC),
together with two other teammates. This has been one of my most memorable
experiences in JC1.</p>
<p>With some previous experience on programming and having taken a course
on machine learning (of course, neither were compulsory, as you will be
well-equipped soon after the research begins), I was very glad to find
this programme that allowed me to work on something that I am passionate
about. &nbsp;Eager to have a hands-on experience doing a real scientific
research, I did not hesitate to sign up.</p>
<p>The research we were offered included using machine learning to categorise
regions in Singapore, in order to draw a connection between public transport
passenger volume data and land use compositions of these regions. This
is indeed a niche and challenging direction in the field, and it is not
surprising that our research did not go smoothly all the time.</p>
<p>However, we were lucky to be mentored by our researcher, who himself is
doing research in this field. We were able to approach our mentor whenever
we met difficulties, and he would always provide valuable advice. In the
interim, we developed our ability to solve problems independently and learned
to value not only the results but also the process – both were important
takeaways from our project. There were times that we seemed to have come
to dead ends but by reading past research papers, testing new methods and
occasionally changing our approach while not losing hope, we eventually
managed to complete this rewarding journey.</p>
<p>Having a research project alongside with curriculum subjects, activities
in my CCA, SIGs and other competitions required a rather delicate balance.
It is vital to bear in mind the long-term vision for our education and
career, and carefully manage conflicts between different commitments. Meanwhile,
it really helped a lot that my teachers have been very flexible with tutorials
and assignments so that I was never under too much pressure.</p>
<p>The Scientist-in-School programme taught me many things I could not have
learned in theories. For example, starting with advanced methods may not
always be a good choice due to various restrictions regarding the data,
and real-life data does not guarantee meaningful outcome like the ones
I would get in a Kaggle contest. These are part of a precious experience
that helps me understand more about what it is like to be a data scientist.
Of course, you may choose a very different subject to research on but I
am sure your experience will be no less rewarding.</p>
<p>So, if you have a research programme in mind, go for it. Find out about
a new field, take up new skills, build up friendships and most importantly.
Have fun!</p>

<p>I have always wanted to pursue a career in the Sciences, however I was
unsure of the specific course or what exactly interests me. The experience
of taking on project that encompassed material science and food science
as part of the NUS Science Research Programme, I was exposed to the inter-disciplinary
nature of research and found myself drawn to it.</p>
<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to go to the lab until mid-November.
I learnt how to adapt with the guidance of my mentor and adjusted the project
to one that can be partially conducted at home. Through the Research Methods
Module (RMM) and the research project, I have learnt various data collection
and organisational methods and lab-related skills that I would have otherwise
not known.</p>
<p>l was initially concerned about the workload and the impact on my school
work, however, by reading up on my research topic consistently, I was able
to spend sufficient time on both areas, without compromising on my social
life.</p>
<p>I am extremely thankful for this learning experience. The programme allows
me to apply what I have learnt in school, as well as to give me an introduction
to Science research at the tertiary level.</p>

<p>Last year, I was awarded the A*STAR Science Award (JC). Due to COVID-19
restrictions, the attachment opportunities at A*STAR were cancelled. Fortunately,
the situation eased in the second part of the year, and I had the opportunity
to do a 5-week research attachment at Genome Institute of Singapore during
the year-end school holidays.</p>
<p>Besides the exciting experience of working in a research lab, I had the
chance to meet people of diverse backgrounds. I got to talk to research
mentors who were studying for their PhDs, university students and polytechnic
students who were in the midst of completing their final-year project.
The advice they gave was truly useful and informative to help me decide
on my future&nbsp;university courses and career choices.</p>
<p>I was anxious about juggling my commitments while working throughout the
December holidays. However, I found out that all it took was good time
management and sufficient preparation done prior to the attachment. Any
spare time I had in the office could be used to finish my schoolwork, revise,
or take a break.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that the attachment has made my December holidays one
of the most meaningful yet. The values, connections and knowledge I acquired
would truly be beneficial to me in the years ahead.</p>

<p>When I first entered NYJC, I did not know which career path was best for
me and I was unsure on what to do in the future: Engineering? Medicine?
Research? I was clueless. By taking part in the Nanyang Research Programme
(NRP), it allowed me to assess whether research was a viable career for
me. This, along with my interest in the environment, chemistry and engineering,
formed the basis for my decision in choosing to take part in an environmental
engineering project in NRP.</p>
<p>The most memorable part of NRP was going to Nanyang Technological University’s
(NTU) research labs, where my research partner and I conducted experiments
and collected data for our project. This was my favourite part of NRP as
it was hands-on and fun. We also wrote research reports by reviewing articles
online. Collecting data and writing reports took up a significant portion
of time that I could have spent on leisure activities. When I felt like
giving up, I pushed myself and persevered. Eventually, by managing my time
properly and prioritising the more important tasks, I was able to juggle
easily between my floorball CCA, academics and NRP. If you are a J1 considering
taking part in NRP, know that the tangible and intangible skills you will
eventually learn are long lasting ones that can be applied in your daily
lives.</p>

<p>In 2020, I had the privilege to be part of A*STAR Scientist-in-School
Programme, working with my schoolmate Carmen Lim and our mentor Mr. Zheng
Yang Chin from A*STAR's Institute for Infocomm Research. Our project aims
to investigate changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) scalp brain signals
during mental arithmetic under varying conditions.</p>
<p>Throughout the duration of the programme, we had meetings with our mentor
over Zoom regularly to learn new skills, review literature and discuss
research plans. I had picked up many important and interesting skills like
coding through Python, signal processing and elementary machine learning.
The programme allowed me to apply information I had learnt in my classes,
like statistics and linear algebra, to real-life applications.</p>
<p>Importantly, it was an opportunity for me to explore an area of interest
of mine, which is computer science. The programme gave me a deeper understanding
and appreciation of computer science and gave me a glimpse into what computer
science is like at the university level and beyond.</p>
<p>The most memorable experience during my research attachment was visiting
Mr. Chin at the Institute for Infocomm Research at Fusionopolis. Due to
COVID-19 restrictions, it was difficult for us to meet our mentor out of
college in the initial stage. Fortunately, during our December holidays,
the restrictions were eased. During the meeting, we discussed our research
plans and learned how to operate the EEG machine. We also had the chance
to explore the A*STAR’s Institute for Infocomm Research.</p>
<p>The programme took up a significant amount time and was taxing but what
I learnt from the programme was definitely worth it! My mentor was understanding
of my CCA commitments (Student Council) and school work, giving my partner
and me sufficient time to revise for our examinations. Balancing my other
commitments with the programme was difficult but manageable through proper
planning and scheduling.</p>
<p>This programme has been a wonderful experience and has allowed me to learn
so much!</p>

<p>I was given the opportunity of research attachment at A*STAR research
institute for my JC1 academic year. With two schoolmates, we worked under
the guidance of a researcher from the Institute of High Performance Computing
(IHPC). The whole experience was very challenging yet rewarding.</p>
<p>We chose to work on the topic of applying computer vision techniques in
the field of material science. We had to quickly familiarise ourselves
with many computer vision techniques that we had never heard of previously.
Looking back at the entire learning process, the most valuable part were
the skills I picked up. Although I had some prior experience with Python,
it is only through this research experience that I became comfortable with
using Python to solve scientific problems, a skill truly invaluable for
anyone interested in STEM-related areas.</p>
<p>The process of literature review, coming up with a hypothesis, writing
our own research paper and presenting it in front of others is something
vastly different from the JC curriculum, but something that is of immense
importance.&nbsp; It gives us a glimpse of research at the undergraduate
level. This experience has allowed me to see how challenging it is to contribute
to academia and how rewarding the results can be.</p>
<p>The team participated in an international competition (ST Yau High School
Science Award) and we had to spend many nights refining our report and
rehearsing our presentation as the deadline was in September which coincided
with the busy Term 3. Things got slightly exhausting when my preparation
for Physics Olympiad coincided with that for the Yau Award, but I managed
to pull both of them off eventually. Looking back at that period of time,
I would say it requires a lot of dedication to do well in the research
project, definitely no less than the effort one should put in to excel
in school subjects.</p>
<p>In short, I would recommend anyone who can manage JC schoolwork to try
out a research project. It gives you a taste of working in the scientific
community and allows you to pick up many important skills for your future
academics and career.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity for a 1-month research attachment at A*STAR, Institute
for Infocomm Research (I2R) in the December holidays last year where I
had a chance to design an artificial intelligence software to detect lesions
in medical scans.</p>
<p>One of my most memorable experiences was visiting A*STAR research institute
with my fellow group members to utilize the more advanced equipment. Fortunately,
both my team members were very patient in teaching me how some of the more
technical computing aspects function, as I was not as proficient in computing
as both of them. Going to A*STAR also allowed us to meet up in person with
our supervisor, Dr. Huang, to ensure that we were on the right track through
meetings and discussions.</p>
<p>This attachment helped solidify my decision that research is the right
path for me, albeit not in this particular sector, as the collaboration
required and excitement from making progress are some of the aspects a
research career can offer, both of which I find intriguing. Apart from
the raw technical skills, a key takeaway for me was to not feel intimidated
from seeking advice or help as if it weren’t for our mentors' guidance,
it would have been extremely challenging to complete our objective since
all the required expertise is extremely advanced.</p>
<p>Although the attachment was very rewarding, it was still challenging as
I had to juggle academics and other commitments at the same time. Thus,
I had to have good time management and consistency in my work - not just
during the holidays, but across the whole year to cope with all these activities.</p>

<p>As a proud Science Research Programme (SRP) participant, I am always eager
to share my experience whenever someone asks me about my time there. My
field of research was on Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically deep
learning. As I had only dealt with basic programming during my lower secondary
days, what I had to familiarise myself with for the research were rather
niche and foreign. However, my worries were soon dispelled as my mentor
was very patient and thorough when guiding me, and was also very forgiving
whenever I made mistakes in the initial stages. Gradually, I became more
independent in my research. During my time there, I was tasked to take
up an online course to understand more about deep learning, and read up
on various research papers in order to deepen my understanding. With my
new found knowledge, I went on to use the artificial intelligence networks
to segment MRI prostate images, and subsequently optimise them such that
they achieve higher accuracies. When I witnessed my experiments picking
up pace and yielded satisfactory results, my contentment was beyond words
and this motivated me to achieve more during the research.</p>
<p>The writing of the actual research paper is, I believe, a part of research
that is often overlooked. To produce a thorough research paper, I had to
learn how to present my findings in the most comprehensible way, amongst
the plethora of diagrams and infographics which I can use. I had to be
concise in documenting my whole research as well, so that the readers can,
more easily, sieve out and highlight valuable information for themselves.
My mentor also imparted a lot of knowledge and tips which were instrumental
in my successful completion of the research paper by the stipulated deadline.
The end results were indisputably gratifying as I see all my hard work
being translated into words and diagrams. Fortunately for me, my mentor
has also published an edited version of my research online, and I could
share with my close friends and family, a titbit of my understanding gained
during the programme.</p>

<p>"Junior College is the last opportunity for me to explore different fields
and stretch my academic capabilities before specialising in university!"
With that in mind, I embarked on my journey to take up H3 MOE SRP Research
project and H3 Chemistry.</p>
<p>Picking a research project was difficult as I felt that most of the topics
were very niche. I decided to take on a project that interests me and exposes
me to an unfamiliar field and I decided on a project about artificial intelligence
and biomedical imaging.</p>
<p>Given that this was my first exposure to computing, I had to be ready
to learn a lot of foreign concepts, and that, I found fascinating. My H3
research project started with me attending various Coursera lessons, before
learning to conduct visual assessments on PET scans for my data collection.
Fortunately, I had a patient professor who was willing to answer my questions
and guide me through the research process. Through it, I was able to pick
up different knowledge and research skills including data analysis.</p>
<p>I admit that balancing my commitments was difficult, but it was not impossible
either! Being intentional to set aside time to relax, strategically planning
my time to maximise my efficiency and having a good support system, enabled
me to thrive.</p>
