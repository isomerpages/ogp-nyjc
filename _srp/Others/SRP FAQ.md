<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>1. What are the benefits of joining a research programme?</strong>
<br>Joining a research programme offers a glimpse of how research is conducted,
and helps students in their decision regarding a career in research. This
would be helpful when it comes to deciding on possible scholarships/university
courses to pursue.</p>
<p><strong>2. Are the research projects conducted on an individual or group basis?</strong>
<br>Research projects can be conducted on an individual or group basis, depending
on the type of project.</p>
<p><strong>3. What is the commitment required for a research project?</strong>
<br>Research projects are usually conducted in JC1, from April to February
of the following year. Students will need to commit a few hours a week
to the research project depending on the project supervisor’s schedule
and expectation, and more intensively during the year-end holidays.</p>
<p><strong>4. Can a student take up more than 1 research project?</strong>
<br>Students are encouraged to apply for more than one research programme
to increase their chances of securing a research project. However, they
are not advised to take up more than one research project if there are
multiple offers as the commitment level for one research project is already
high.</p>
<p><strong>5. Will my research project clash with my CCA/lessons?</strong>
<br>Students are usually able to work out a suitable schedule with their research
mentors and team mates.</p>
<p><strong>6. Are there any pre-requisites to join the research project?</strong>
<br>There are generally no pre-requisites for most of the research projects.</p>
<p><strong>7. Where is the research conducted?</strong>
<br>Research work will be conducted either at the research institutes (e.g.
A*Star) or higher institutes of learning (e.g. NUS, NTU, SUTD etc).</p>
<p><strong>8. Do I need to have prior coding knowledge to join the research programme?</strong>
<br>Not necessary. However, most research projects may need basic coding knowledge.
Students are usually able to pick up the relevant skills required for research
projects during the process.</p>
