The Scientist-in-School Programme provides students research opportunities to further deepen their knowledge and interest in science research, by collaborating with external scientific institutions that offer attachments.

Through attachments, the students are given opportunities to work in collaborative groups, designing methods, collecting data and analysing them to simulate how scientists work. This will help develop creative and critical thinking skills, as well as to strengthen their problem solving skills.

Eligibility:

*   Open to all JC1 students
*   Have a passion for science and research

Any new opportunities will be announced on the NYJC Learning Portal.
