<p>The NY Research Partnerships (title renamed to this) provides students
research opportunities to further deepen their knowledge and interest in
research, by collaborating with external institutions that offer attachments.</p>
<p>Through attachments, the students are given opportunities to work in collaborative
groups, designing methods, collecting data and analysing them to simulate
how scientists work. This will help develop creative and critical thinking
skills, as well as to strengthen their problem solving skills.</p>
<p>Eligibility:
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open to all JC1 students
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a passion for research
<br>
<br>Any new opportunities will be announced on the NYJC Learning Portal.</p>
