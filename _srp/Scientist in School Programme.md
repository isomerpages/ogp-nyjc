The Scientist-in-School Programme provides students research opportunities to further deepen their knowledge and interest in science research, by collaborating with external scientific institutions that offer attachments.

Through attachments, the students are given opportunities to work in collaborative groups, designing methods, collecting data and analysing them to simulate how scientists work. This will help develop creative and critical thinking skills, as well as to strengthen their problem solving skills.

Eligibility:

*   Open to all JC1 students

_Role of BCAA in HCC progression_

Previous works in the lab have discovered that liver tumor cells downregulate branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism and divert these essential amino acids towards anabolic and growth processes. We are currently focused on three key aims as a continuation of the studies:

(1) To understand the role of other metabolites such as branched chain keto acid (BCKA), N-acetyl BCAA and branched chain hydroxyacids in driving tumor growth;

(2) To understand and characterize the cellular machinery that drives the uptake of these metabolites in liver tumors as a potential therapeutic target;

(3) To design drugs to inhibit the usage of these metabolites by liver tumors.

_Investigation of sweetness of watermelons using Phyphox_

Ever wondered if there were a quantitative method to determine the sweetness of watermelons? This project aims to utilise the app “Phyphox” to scientifically measure the sweetness of a watermelon based on the sound that it produces when tapped.

You will be part of a team who will investigate the various properties that will help determine how to choose the sweetest watermelon. Sounds easy? Think twice!

This project will allow you to learn about the world of acoustics, signal processing, physical testing of watermelon sweetness (think food science) and app development.

You will also have the chance to work in a NUS Physics Lab. Interested students must be taking both H2 Physics and H2 Math.

Students who are interested to participate in this programme are to indicate your interest through this [**form**](https://form.gov.sg/63d20fd0dd51570011bc16f9).
