On 25th February, we hosted a dialogue with the Admission Directors from the local autonomous universities.  It was a very fruitful session where the representatives shared candidly their views on the courses offered, their undergraduates, the scholarships and opportunities, and even memorable testimonials that they had read.  We have collated the answers to almost all of the questions posed and hope that this would be a useful reference to those who are thinking about their university applications.
