<p>We are deeply saddened by the passing of our chairman of school management
committee, Dr. Wee Cho Yaw. Dr. Wee had seen our college through the onsite
rebuilding of the college campus, and more recently, the establishment
of the NYJC Zhong Zheng Ren Scholarship. The college is grateful for Dr.
Weeâ€™s generosity and support for the college.</p>
