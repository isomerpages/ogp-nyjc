<p>We are deeply saddened by the passing of our School Management Committee
Chairman, Dr Wee Cho Yaw. He had dedicated his life to the betterment of
education in our college. His generous contributions in the area of upgrading
the school’s learning facilities and the establishment of the NYJC Zhong
Zheng Ren Scholarship, supported the holistic development of our students.
On behalf of the school’s staff and students, we would like to express
our heartfelt condolences to Dr Wee’s family.</p>
<p>Thank you, Sir, for all that you have done for NYJCians.</p>
