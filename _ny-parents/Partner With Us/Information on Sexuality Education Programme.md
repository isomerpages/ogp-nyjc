<h2>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexuality Education
(SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological,
social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy
and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite
sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.
SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society.
This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear
family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of
SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic
and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goals of Sexuality
Education are to:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through the
provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate&nbsp;<u>knowledge</u>&nbsp;on
human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help
students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships
through the acquisition of&nbsp;<u>social and emotional skills</u>&nbsp;of
self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours,
development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication,
problem-solving and decision-making skills; and</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help students
develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual
beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society, through the
inculcation of&nbsp;<u>positive mainstream values and attitudes</u>&nbsp;about
sexuality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love
and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build
positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation
for strong families);</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make responsible
decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstinence before
marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies.
Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>

Pre-University is on respectful relationships. Specifically, the JC/CI
package covers Interpersonal Relationships, with themes of Human Development,
Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and Culture, Society and Law woven into
the main focus on relationships.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. <em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;is a programme developed by Health Promotion Board,
in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, to provide JC/CI Year
1 students with accurate information on STI/HIV and protection from a health
perspective so as to enable them to make wise, informed, and sensible decisions.</p>
<p>7. Students learn the health, social and financial implications of STIs/HIV
on an individual and the family if he/she gets infected with STIs/HIV and
the importance of responsible decision-making and knowing where to seek
help. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages. The
desired outcome of the <em>eTeens</em> programme is that students are empowered
to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.</p>
