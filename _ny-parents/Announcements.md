**Principal's Sharing with Parents of JC1s**

A good number of parents attended the virtual sharing session on Friday (10 Feb 23) and we thank you for your encouraging feedback.&nbsp; Some of you were unable to join us and as promised in our earlier correspondence, we are sharing with you, the deck of slides that contain key information including the college's focus, important dates, promotional criteria. We have also included an info sheet covering an introduction to two compulsory H1 subjects: General&nbsp;Paper and Project Work.
