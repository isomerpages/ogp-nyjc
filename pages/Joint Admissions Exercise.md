The 2024 JAE registration will be held over 6 calendar days starting from the release of O-level results.

More information can be found on MOE's website [here](http://www.moe.gov.sg/jae).

The JAE posting results will be released on **Thursday, 1 February 2024** through:

1 JAE-IS, accessible through the JAE website.

2 Short Messaging System (SMS) via applicant’s mobile number (if provided by applicants during the JAE).

<h2>Cut Off &amp; Bonus Points</h2>

Applicants applying to enter NYJC must meet the entry criteria based on the L1R5 aggregate.

For JAE, this aggregate is calculated from results obtained in the previous year's Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examinations.

Please note that the entry criteria changes from year to year and the following table should only be used as a guide.

<table class="ive_eobj_center iveo_table ives_tab_simple3"><tbody><tr><td colspan="3" width="245"><b>MINIMUM L1R5 AGGREGATE<br>[after bonus points deduction]</b></td></tr><tr><td width="85"><b>FACULTY</b></td><td width="66"><b>ARTS</b></td><td width="95"><b>SCIENCE</b></td></tr><tr><td width="85">JAE 2023</td><td width="66">6</td><td width="95">5</td></tr></tbody></table>

Applicants are posted to courses based first on the applicants' merit and second, in the order of the applicants' choice of courses. Applicants with better aggregates will be considered for admission first. Each applicant is then considered for his/her choice of courses in the order of preference indicated, subject to available vacancies in the course.

**Am I eligible for bonus point deductions?**

The table below shows the number of bonus points awarded if you:

<table class="iveo_table ives_tab_simple3" width="595"><tbody><tr><td width="387">Are a student from Chung Cheng High School (Main) and (Yishun) and NYJC is your:<p></p><p>a. 1st choice, or<br>b. 1st and 2nd choices.</p></td><td width="47">2</td></tr><tr><td width="387">Obtained a CCA Attainment ‘Excellent’ or Grade 'A' from your secondary school</td><td width="47">2</td></tr><tr><td width="387">Obtained CCA Attainment ‘Good’ or Grade&nbsp; 'B' or 'C' from your secondary school</td><td width="47">1</td></tr><tr><td width="387">Have grades A1 to C6 in both your first languages (i.e. English and a Higher Mother Tongue)</td><td width="47">2</td></tr><tr><td width="387">Are accepted to offer Chinese&nbsp;Language Elective Programme (CLEP)&nbsp;in Nanyang JC</td><td width="47">2</td></tr></tbody></table>

Bonus points are limited to a maximum of 4 points without CLEP. With CLEP, the maximum bonus points is 6 points. Applicants should note that if admitted to CLEP, MOE requires students to remain in the programme regardless of whether they had utilised the 2 bonus points. Students who fail to do so may be asked to leave the JC.

<h2>Subject Combination Information</h2>
A-level subjects can now be taken at 3 levels: H1, H2 and H3.

*   H1 level (1 academic unit per H1 subject) - Half of H2 in terms of curriculum time
*   H2 level (2 academic unit per H2 subject) - Equivalent to what was previously termed A-Level subjects
*   H3 level (1 academic unit per H3 subject) - Subjects with diverse learning opportunities for in-depth study (e.g. advanced content, research paper, university&nbsp; module).&nbsp; Students must read the corresponding subject at H2 level.

**Compulsory subjects**

The following subjects are compulsory and will be taken at H1 level:

1\. **Mother Tongue Language(MTL)**, which is examined at the end of JC 1. It cannot be replaced by another subject. (A student who achieves grade D7 or better in Higher MTL at O-level is exempted from H1 MTL)

2\. **Project Work(PW)**, is examined in JC 1.

3\. **General Paper**, is examined at the end of JC 2.

**Content-based subjects**

· In addition to the GP, PW and MTL, students must read at least four content-based subjects.  
· Three of the content-based subjects must be at the H2 level and the fourth content-based subject may be at the H1 or H2 level.

**Contrasting subjects**

· At least one of the four content-based subjects read must be a contrasting subject.  
· Students specialising in Humanities and the Arts will need to read a contrasting subject from Mathematics and Sciences.

**Requirements for taking 4 H2 subjects**

Students who meet the respective cut-off point for their stream are eligible to take 4 H2 subjects.

**More about H3 Level**

The H3 subject is an extension of the H2 subject that is read in JC2 and it entails an in-depth study of a particular area that the student has the ability for and a passionate interest in. At the end of the JC1 year, the top 10% of the JC1 cohort (based on their JC1 final examination results) would be offered the opportunity to take H3 subjects.

<h2>Chinese Language Elective Programme and Art Elective Programme</h2>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

**1 How will I be posted?**

Applicants are posted to courses based first on the applicant’s merit, and second in the order of applicants’ choice of courses. All applicants are first ranked in the order of their net L1R5 aggregates, taking into account the various bonus points for which the applicants are eligible.

First, applicants with better aggregates will be considered for admission. Then, each applicant is considered for his/her choice of courses in the order of preferences indicated, subject to available vacancies in the course.

In situations where there are two or more applicants with the same net aggregate score vying for the last place in a course, they will be posted based on their citizenship status. If there is still a tie, say between two Singapore citizens, the one with the better gross aggregate score will be posted into the course first. If there is still a tie at this stage, then posting into the course will be determined by a computerised ballot where each candidate is given an equal opportunity.

**2 How is the cut-off point calculated?**

The cut-off point is the net aggregate (L1R5) of the last student posted to the college. So if the cut-off point is 5, it means that all students who were admitted through JAE will have a net score of 5 or lower.

**3 Is the cut-off point determined by the college?**

The college does not set the cut-off point. It is based on the choices of that particular year's cohort and is based on demand and supply.

**4 NYJC's cut-off point was 5 points in 2023. Do I stand a chance if my net L1R5 is 6?**

The cut-off point may differ from year to year. The cut-off point for 2023 merely serves as a reference when students consider their choices.

**5 Can I have a list of subject combinations offered by NYJC?**

NYJC takes pride in its flexible subject combination system. As long as a student meets the individual subject criteria and fulfils the contrasting subject requirement of the posted stream, he will most likely be offered his choice of subjects.

On an average, the college offers more than 60 different subject combinations each year. The more popular combinations are:

Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Economics

Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics

Chemistry, Mathematics and Economics

Physics, Mathematics and Economics

**6 When will I get to choose my subject combination?**

Students will choose their subject combination within the first two days of reporting to NYJC after their posting result. More details will be given during the orientation.

**7** **When will the Art Elective Programme (AEP)/Computing/Further Mathematics/Translation (Chinese) selection test be held?**

The various selection tests for interested JC1s will be held on the first day of reporting to NYJC. An announcement will be made during the subject combination talk to inform interested students.

Additional information for AEP Selection Test:

Students will submit their portfolio for assessment the day after the selection test. The portfolio should include a range of works that best showcase the student’s interest and ability in handling different media and craft types. The portfolio submitted can either be the original pieces or well-documented digital images of the student's artworks.

Selection test consists of 3 components:

DAY 1 of reporting: Written Test (30 min), Drawing &amp; Painting Test (1 hr);  
DAY 2 of reporting: Portfolio Interview (15 min)

**8 How do I apply to the CLEP in NYJC?**

You would need to indicate your choice when submitting your online application for JAE. Students who are eligible for the CLEP will be offered the option to enrol through the online application. You&nbsp;must&nbsp;select NYJC as your first choice if you are interested to join the CLEP in NYJC, otherwise you might be posted to other CLEP centres.

If you did not apply for the CLEP at NYJC during JAE, you can still appeal to join the programme after you have been posted to NYJC. MOE will make the final decision on the approval of this application.
