<p>Bonus points are capped at 4 points without CLEP. With CLEP, the maximum
bonus points is 6. Applicants should note that if they are admitted to
CLEP, MOE requires them to remain in the programme regardless of whether
they had utilised the 2 bonus points. Students who fail to do so may be
asked to leave the JC.</p>

<h2>Chinese Language Elective Programme and Art Elective Programme</h2>
<p>In addition to the above, NYJC also offers both the Chinese Language Elective
Programme (<strong>CLEP</strong>) and the Art Elective Programme (<strong>AEP</strong>).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Programme Requirements</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Applicants must have good results in the GCE ‘O’ Level Examination, obtaining
at least:</p>
<p>· B3 in Higher Chinese (alternatively B4 in Higher Chinese and B3 in Chinese
Literature),
<br>· <strong>OR</strong> A2 in Chinese,
<br>· <strong>OR</strong> The equivalent of the above based on IP school internal
assessment.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Art Elective Programme (AEP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Students can expect to offer H2 and H3 Art at GCE A-Level. The H3 Art
syllabus complements the H2 Art Syllabus, providing students who have exceptional
interest and ability with opportunities to be engaged in the Theory of
Art.</p>
<p><strong>Entry Requirements for AEP</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who wish to do Art at the H2 &amp; H3 levels are required to
sit for a Drawing &amp; Painting Test and a Written Test administered by
NYJC AEP Unit to assess their aptitude for the course. Students are also
required to attend an interview and present their portfolio.</p>
<p>Students can find out more about the elective programmes <strong><a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/pre-university" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.<br></a></strong>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>1 How will I be posted?</strong>
</p>
<p>Applicants are posted to courses based first on the applicant’s merit,
and second in the order of applicant's choice of courses. All applicants
are first ranked in the order of their net L1R5 aggregates, taking into
account the various bonus points for which the applicants are eligible.</p>
<p>First, applicants with better aggregates will be considered for admission.
Then, each applicant is considered for his/her choice of courses in the
order of preferences indicated, subject to available vacancies in the course.</p>
<p>In situations where there are two or more applicants with the same net
aggregate score vying for the last place in a course, they will be posted
based on their citizenship status. If there is still a tie, say between
two Singapore citizens, the one with the better gross aggregate score will
be posted into the course first. If there is still a tie at this stage,
then posting into the course will be determined by a computerised ballot
where each candidate is given an equal opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>2 How is the cut-off point calculated?</strong>
</p>
<p>The cut-off point is the net aggregate (L1R5) of the last student posted
to the college. So if the cut-off point is 5, it means that all students
who were admitted through JAE will have a net score of 5 or lower.</p>
<p><strong>3 Is the cut-off point determined by the college?</strong>
</p>
<p>The college does not set the cut-off point. It is based on the choices
of that particular year's cohort and is based on demand and supply.</p>
<p><strong>4 NYJC's cut-off point was 5 points in 2024. Do I stand a chance if my net L1R5 is 6?</strong>
</p>
<p>The cut-off point may differ from year to year. The cut-off point for
2024 merely serves as a reference when students consider their choices.</p>
<p><strong>5 Can I have a list of subject combinations offered by NYJC?</strong>
</p>
<p>NYJC takes pride in its flexible subject combination system.</p>
<p>On an average, the college offers more than 60 different subject combinations
each year. The more popular combinations are:</p>
<p>Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Economics</p>
<p>Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics</p>
<p>Chemistry, Mathematics and Economics</p>
<p>Physics, Mathematics and Economics</p>
<p><strong>6 When will I get to choose my subject combination?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will choose their subject combination within the first two days
of reporting to NYJC after their posting result. More details will be given
during the orientation.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong>  <strong>When will the Art Elective Programme (AEP)/Computing/Further Mathematics/Translation (Chinese) selection test be held?</strong>
</p>
<p>The various selection tests for interested JC1s will be held on the first
day of reporting to NYJC. An announcement will be made during the subject
combination talk to inform interested students.</p>
<p>Additional information for AEP Selection Test:</p>
<p>Students will submit their portfolio for assessment the day after the
selection test. The portfolio should include a range of works that best
showcase the student’s interest and ability in handling different media
and craft types. The portfolio submitted can either be the original pieces
or well-documented digital images of the student's artworks.</p>
<p>Selection test consists of 3 components:</p>
<p>DAY 1 of reporting: Written Test (30 min), Drawing &amp; Painting Test
(1 hr);
<br>DAY 2 of reporting: Portfolio Interview (15 min)</p>
<p><strong>8 How do I apply to the CLEP in NYJC?</strong>
</p>
<p>You would need to indicate your choice when submitting your online application
for JAE. Students who are eligible for the CLEP will be offered the option
to enrol through the online application. You&nbsp;must&nbsp;select NYJC
as your first choice if you are interested to join the CLEP in NYJC, otherwise
you might be posted to other CLEP centres.</p>
<p>If you did not apply for the CLEP at NYJC during JAE, you can still appeal
to join the programme after you have been posted to NYJC. MOE will make
the final decision on the approval of this application.</p>
