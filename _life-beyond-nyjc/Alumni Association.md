<p>The Nanyang Junior College Alumni Association was officially registered on 15 June 1988. Their first annual general meeting was held on 17 June 1989. Over the years, the association has enjoyed the support of former NYJCians, including those from the very first batch.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association hopes to develop and maintain the friendships formed at Nanyang JC, to strengthen the ties between the graduated and current students, and to maintain contact with staff past and present. The Association, with the support of its members, actively contributes to the college. To support the college in its student leadership&nbsp;development, the Association introduced the NY Achiever Award that is given on College Day to students who have excelled in both their studies and in community service. It also supports major college events like the Open House, College Day and EDspiration (ECG Day).</p>
<p>If you would like to be part of the Association so that you can do your part for your alma mater, please fill in the membership enquiry form and the Association will get in touch with you.</p>
