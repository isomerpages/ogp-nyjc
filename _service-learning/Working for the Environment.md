**Past Projects Ideas** 

2010 was the first time we collaborated with N'Parks in our staff Service-Learning project, Project NYrture. We had 2 activities, namely Invasive Species Management @ Upper Peirce Reservoir and Tree Survey @ Mac Ritchie Park.

Based on the partner's feedback, the tree survey is almost complete for Mac Ritchie Park. Our teachers have provided a great help in collecting the data of the trees in Mac Ritchie Park. The information is stored in the Geographic Information System (GIS) Portal maintained by NParks.

Our partner from NParks, Mr Roy Tan commented, “Before the NYJC staff came, the plot of land along the Upper Peirce Reservoir access road was full of Dracena (a.k.a. Tie Shu. Dracena is one of the hardest plant to remove due to their roots being firmly entrenched in the soil). Through the teamwork and hard work of the NYJC staff, a considerable amount of Dracena was removed from that area. We noticed that due to the efforts in removing the Dracena from that area, young plants have started to grow in that area. Some of the pioneer species such as Macaranga bancana, have started to grow and this is a good sign that the forest is already starting to rejuvenate.”

**Horseshoe Crab Project 2009-2010**

This Service-Learning project was run by NYJC’s Science Research Programme which involved mainly the finding and researching on Horseshoe Crab and on some occasion and helping out Singapore Nature Society in cleaning the site on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. Under this project, students had to find horseshoe crabs, and label them so as to be able to track them in the future. At the same time, they were also supposed to rescue these crabs that were trapped in nets that were thrown away by people. At the Kranji mudflats, students also had to wade in the mud and feel around the mud for any horseshoe crabs which are hiding under it to escape the heat of the sun. Also, once a crab has been located, you would have to avoid harming the crab like pulling its tail or damaging the eyes. Lastly, the students were also supposed to identify horseshoe crabs that were mating and report it to the person-in-charge.

**Student Reflections** 

Na Yiting & Valerie Chew from 0901 shared insights on the Horseshoe Crab Project, “Initially, we had expected it to be a one-off event but after getting down in the mud, we realized that Singapore still has a long way to go before she can truly be considered as an eco-friendly city. Granted, the work was dirty but the satisfaction we got when we managed to find the cleverly camouflaged crabs was indescribable. It definitely takes a sharp and experienced eye to find these hidden crabs.”
