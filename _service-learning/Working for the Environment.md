<p><strong>Past Projects Ideas</strong>
</p>
<p>2010 was the first time we collaborated with N'Parks in our staff Service-Learning
project, Project NYrture. We had 2 activities, namely Invasive Species
Management @ Upper Peirce Reservoir and Tree Survey @ Mac Ritchie Park.</p>
<p>Based on the partner's feedback, the tree survey is almost complete for
Mac Ritchie Park. Our teachers have provided a great help in collecting
the data of the trees in Mac Ritchie Park. The information is stored in
the Geographic Information System (GIS) Portal maintained by NParks.</p>
<p>Our partner from NParks, Mr Roy Tan commented, “Before the NYJC staff
came, the plot of land along the Upper Peirce Reservoir access road was
full of Dracena (a.k.a. Tie Shu. Dracena is one of the hardest plant to
remove due to their roots being firmly entrenched in the soil). Through
the teamwork and hard work of the NYJC staff, a considerable amount of
Dracena was removed from that area. We noticed that due to the efforts
in removing the Dracena from that area, young plants have started to grow
in that area. Some of the pioneer species such as Macaranga bancana, have
started to grow and this is a good sign that the forest is already starting
to rejuvenate.”</p>
<p><strong>Horseshoe Crab Project 2009-2010</strong>
</p>
<p>This Service-Learning project was run by NYJC’s Science Research Programme
which involved mainly the finding and researching on Horseshoe Crab and
on some occasion and helping out Singapore Nature Society in cleaning the
site on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. Under this project, students had
to find horseshoe crabs, and label them so as to be able to track them
in the future. At the same time, they were also supposed to rescue these
crabs that were trapped in nets that were thrown away by people. At the
Kranji mudflats, students also had to wade in the mud and feel around the
mud for any horseshoe crabs which are hiding under it to escape the heat
of the sun. Also, once a crab has been located, you would have to avoid
harming the crab like pulling its tail or damaging the eyes. Lastly, the
students were also supposed to identify horseshoe crabs that were mating
and report it to the person-in-charge.</p>
<p><strong>Student Reflections</strong>
</p>
<p>Na Yiting &amp; Valerie Chew from 0901 shared insights on the Horseshoe
Crab Project, “Initially, we had expected it to be a one-off event but
after getting down in the mud, we realized that Singapore still has a long
way to go before she can truly be considered as an eco-friendly city. Granted,
the work was dirty but the satisfaction we got when we managed to find
the cleverly camouflaged crabs was indescribable. It definitely takes a
sharp and experienced eye to find these hidden crabs.”</p>
