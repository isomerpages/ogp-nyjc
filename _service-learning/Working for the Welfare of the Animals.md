**Past Projects Ideas** 

The inaugural Wild Run is the fundraising component of a Student Initiated Project which aims to benefit the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), Singapore. Headed by the AEP club, students from 1410 and 1430 helped to raise funds for the SPCA to support their efforts in providing shelter and care for stray animals in Singapore.

A total of $2451.30 was raised from this event.
