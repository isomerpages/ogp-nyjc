<p>1409 &amp; 1432 Service Learning Project- Christmas Party @ CDAC 9 Dec
2014</p>
<p>Classes 1409 and 1432 embarked on a collaborative S-L project which aimed
to spread the joy of giving this Christmas season by engaging children
in a series of games and activities during their Christmas Fiesta 2014.
Participants from the two classes collaborated with 3 different CDAC centres
where the Christmas Party was held. The 3 sessions were held in the morning
at Tanjong Katong Headquarters, while the other 2 concurrent sessions were
held in the afternoon at Redhill and Punggol centres respectively. In order
to maximize the student-child ratio, we split the children up into groups
of 5 where 1 of us played the role of a group facilitator for each of the
4 groups.</p>
<p>The Christmas Party started off with some icebreaker games so as to break
the ice among ourselves and the children, followed by an Art &amp; Craft
session where the children made pencil holders using ice-cream sticks.
Then, to emphasize the spirit of thanksgiving during the Christmas season,
the next activity, Not-so-secret-Santa, required the children to make and
decorate Christmas cards for their family members or friends. We wanted
to encourage the children to think of the things that their family members
and friends have done for them which they are grateful for. The Christmas
Party ended with a Christmas Quest where we had several station games such
as A-Z Freeze Game, Group Knot, Save Santa through Math and Mini Science
Convention.</p>
<p><strong>Student Reflections</strong>
</p>
<p>Rachel Goh (1409) &amp; Nicolette Chua (1432) have this to say, “Although
the Christmas Party was only a 3-hour programme, we are convinced all of
us learnt a lot from this project, right from the planning to the preparation,
even before the actual execution of the programme. As much as we tried
to stick to the programme flow and the allocated timings, we still had
to adapt to changes. For instance, we set 30 minutes for icebreaker games
initially but after the morning session, we realised that the Art &amp;
Craft session required much more time than allocated. Hence, we decided
to cut 10 minutes from the icebreakers and made adjustments throughout
the afternoon sessions. This experience has taught us the importance of
improvisation in such situations. Also, since we were working with children,
the project taught us to be more patient especially when dealing with the
rowdy ones.”</p>
