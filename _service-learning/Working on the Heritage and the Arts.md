**Past Projects Ideas** 

**Viva La Music** 

On 23rd July 2010, Lecture Theatre 4 of Nanyang Junior College (NYJC) was transformed into a concert hall featuring more than 10 performances by the school’s very own students competing in 4 categories. The event, Viva la Music, was more than a showcase of musical talent in the college. Besides the “Band” and “Instrumental Category”, other talents had a chance in the limelight in the “Diversity” and “Dance” categories as well. Lasting more than 2 hours, a full house audience of 680 feasted their eyes on a wide array of performances, from slow singing to energetic cheer-leading.

The economic downturn in 2010 alerted the event’s organisers, the 32nd AVA Club, to the financial problems of families with school-going children. As a result, besides the celebration of talent in NYJC, the event adopted the Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (SPMF) as its beneficiary. In all, $2,700 was donated, exceeding the initial target of $2,500.

**Student Reflections** 

Tan Xue Si, President of the 33rd AVA Club felt that the event was also an occasion for the club members to bond. “In organising Viva (la Music), both the J1 and J2 had to come together and work as a unit to ensure the success of the event. Although we spent only a few days together throughout the planning, rehearsal and execution phases, the long hours together each day meant that we learnt about each other's strengths and weaknesses, and built a stronger team spirit.”

Summing up his thoughts of Viva la Music, he said: “At the end of the day, we helped others, but not only that, we also became more united as a club.”
