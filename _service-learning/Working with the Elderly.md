<p><strong>Past Projects Ideas</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Bright Homes Programme (Since 2004 until present)</strong>
</p>
<p>Bright Homes is a collaboration with Central CDC where bi-monthly (from
April to February) about 25 students from the Interact Club will visit
a selected Senior Activities Centre (e.g. Redhill, Sin Ming, Toa Payoh
Blk 62B) and design and run a variety of activities (e.g. movie screenings,
farm visits, bus rides to view Christmas light-up, fall prevention, talks,
courses and workshops on using the Internet, and even spa treatments, festival
celebrations, quarterly birthday celebrations and home cleaning) to befriend
and brighten up the elderly residents’ lives, especially those living in
one room rental flats.</p>
<p><strong>Student Reflections</strong>
</p>
<p>According to Goh Hao Wee (CT 1406), “With the activities planned for the
elderly residents, we saw many more smiles than we had ever seen. We befriended
the elderly so that they will not feel isolated or abandoned, and in turn
will possess a healthy mind and body as they age.”</p>
<p>Ang Kay Li (CT 1410) also states, “We were able to pick up tips to communicate
more effectively with the elderly. We learnt to communicate more effectively
in various dialects, learnt to be sensitive to the needs of the elderly
and understand the importance of our heritage. Also, since some of us seldom
interact with the elderly in our society, this was a rare opportunity to
learn lessons in humility, dignity and respect.</p>
<p>Joey Tan (Handball, CCA), “It was super heart-warming as they looked interested
and contented after trying out and knowing more about handball. My duties
were rather simple as my job was to explain how the 'Scratch Art' works
and also to distribute the template, pencils and the papers to the interested
participants. However, it was really fun and meaningful to be able to interact
with the elderly residents. Being able to speak dialect, I was able to
converse with majority of the elderly and I got to know more about them
like their daily routine and life. It was definitely a rare opportunity
to be able to interact, teach as well as to learn more about the elderly
residents.”</p>
