<p>The International Service-Learning Expedition (ISLE) is an educational
and experiential programme that brings students beyond the shores of Singapore
into new contexts for service and learning. It challenges entrenched assumptions,
stereotypes, and preconceived notions, while exposing students to learning
that extends beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Through immersion and cross-cultural engagement, students are encouraged
to re-examine their values and beliefs, develop deeper empathy, and gain
a fuller appreciation of Singapore and the world around them. ISLE also
invites students to serve beyond their comfort zones—building relationships
with communities and contributing to real needs with humility and respect.</p>
<p>At its core, ISLE values the process of learning and transformation as
much as outcomes. NYJC believes that service-learning is about meaningful
contribution, mutual growth, and a transformative mindset that students
carry with them beyond the expedition.</p>
