Communication is key to building successful relationship.  The college’s emphasis on establishing strong, trusting positive relationship through effective communication is seen in the introduction of a Corporate Communications and Partnership Department in 2014.

The department oversees the different communication plans, to ensure a clear consistent message to the public on who we are, what we do, and what we believe in. Areas of work pertaining to Corporate Communications include the management and evaluation of media relations, branding and publicity, social media platforms, and the website.

The college’s partnership efforts are also coordinated by the department. We work hand in hand with the Parent Advisory Committee, Alumni and community partners to plan and facilitate programmes to support the holistic development of NYJCians.
