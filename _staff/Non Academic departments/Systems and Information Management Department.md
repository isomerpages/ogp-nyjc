The department formulates and reviews the college’s policy on systems and information management.  Through close monitoring and regular evaluation of the college’s processes, the department ensures that the college’s management systems are effective and robust, and that the information provided is up-to-date and relevant.

The department is also responsible for all matters pertaining to School Cockpit and School Excellence Model (SEM).  it works closely with the SEM criterion owners to identify and track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and organize college data to not only facilitate SEM or other award nominations, but more importantly to identify areas for improvement in order to achieve organisational excellence.
