<p>The Student Affairs and Management Department handles everything that
concerns students so that students can be well-balanced individuals in
a changing world.</p>
<p>Its programmes include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Counselling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career guidance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foreign students’ welfare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scholarship and Bursary Application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pastoral Care Programme</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Counselling</strong>
</p>
<p>The college is aware of the many problems that students may face as adolescents
as they respond to adult demands, group pressure, new environments and
new study habits. To take care of this need, we have made available teacher-counsellors
who are trained to help students cope with the pressure of college life.
There is also an online counselling service provided.</p>
<p><strong>Career Guidance Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>College life does not consist of mere preparation for the GCE ‘A’ Level
examinations. There is also the emphasis on educating students and preparing
them for the wider aspects of life. The Career Guidance programme aims
to prepare students for the job market and the working world. People with
professional expertise are invited to give talks and conduct seminars for
students. These serve to inform students about the necessary qualifications
needed for various careers and to teach them how to match personality to
career as well as handling job interviews.</p>
<p>Students may approach our ECG Counsellor, Mr Shaun Han, if they need more
personalised guidance and advice on their higher education and career aspirations
and choices.</p>

<p><strong>Foreign Students’ Welfare Committee</strong>
</p>
<p>Like many other institutions in Singapore, we accept a small number of
foreign students into our college each year. There is a committee to look
into their essentials such as accommodation and student passes. The committee
also provides the necessary socio-emotional support to help students cope
with their stay in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Life Skills Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The college recognises the importance of imparting relevant life skills
which are deemed necessary for successful living. These skills aim to help
students cope with the stresses and challenges of daily life as well as
to help them make responsible and sound decisions. We also hope that these
life skills can be relevant and useful to students even after their junior
college education.</p>
<p>The college focuses on six areas of life skills. They include:</p>
<p>Lifeskills One: Self-Awareness</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Two: Self-Management (Physical and mental well-being)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three: Social and Global Awareness (Social awareness, civic literacy,
global awareness, cross cultural skills)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four: Decision-making (Research, decision-making and problem-solving skills)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Five: Critical Thinking and Inventive Thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six: Communication and Interpersonal Skills</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Lifeskills Framework adopts a holistic and comprehensive approach,
which served as the guiding principle to help students develop the fundamental
skills for life effectiveness. In NYJC, students will learn to effectively
manage themselves, their relationships with others and varied life situations.
Students are encouraged to do self-reflection and discuss areas for improvements
during conferences with their tutors using the Managing Self Development
Tool.</p>

<p>The school counsellor may be found in her office, located in the Media-Resource
Library; or you may contact her at 6-380-5174. She would be available from
9am to 3pm, but should you require an earlier or later appointment, it
can be arranged. You may choose to speak with her face-to-face or through
e-mail.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, counselling is not only for individuals with
severe mental or emotional problems. In fact, most of the students seeking
counselling are able to cope in most areas of their life, except for the
one or two difficult areas they might need help with, such as managing
time better, dealing with test anxiety, working at struggles with communication
or assertiveness, managing anger and relationships better. Counselling
offers you an opportunity to explore the issue and to find strategies to
help you cope better so that you may achieve your goals in life.</p>
<p>The things that you tell your counsellor are subject to a strict code
of confidentiality, and your counsellor will not reveal these to anyone
without your permission. There are, however, a few limits to confidentiality,
such as when the counsellor finds that your life is in danger. There are
times when you might need to seek help from a 24-hour hotline. These are
some hotline numbers you may call.</p>
