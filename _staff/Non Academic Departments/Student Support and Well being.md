<p><strong>Pastoral Care</strong>
</p>
<p>The Year Head system was introduced to support students' holistic development
through meaningful teacher-student relationships. The Year Head team oversees
student management matters and provides counselling support when needed,
serving as mentors who support students' academic progress alongside their
personal growth and emotional well-being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team also works closely with Civics Tutors who, through regular check-ins
and conferencing, support students in reflecting on their learning, well-being
and personal development -&nbsp; helping them navigate their JC journey
with confidence.</p>
<p>This approach is grounded in a growth mindset philosophy that empowers
students to view challenges as opportunities for learning and development,
building resilience and enabling them to maximise their potential.</p>
<p><strong>Peer Support Structure</strong>
</p>
<p>NYJC strengthens a caring and inclusive school culture through Peer Supporters
who foster positive classroom environments and provide peer-level emotional
support. Collectively, these structures help students feel supported, capable
and connected, enabling them to thrive academically and personally.
<br>
<br><strong> Counselling Services</strong>
</p>
<p>The College recognises that students may face academic, emotional and
social challenges as they navigate the demands of JC life. We provide comprehensive
support through a dedicated team:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Class Civics Tutors, who serve as first points of contact for day-to-day
support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Year Heads, who oversee cohort-level pastoral care initiatives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A trained Teacher-Counsellor, who provides specialised support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The School Counsellor and Education and Career Guidance(ECG) Counsellor,
who offer professional counselling and guidance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these teams create a safe and supportive environment that builds
emotional resilience, nurtures mental well-being, and enables every student
to grow with confidence.
