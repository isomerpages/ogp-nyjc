<p><strong>MSLO Framework&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>At Nanyang Junior College, character development is central to education
and is integrated through the holistic Managing Self, Leading Others (MSLO)
framework. This commitment is reflected in the college mission to Uphold
Values, Enhance Life Skills, and Maximise Potential, supported by comprehensive
Character and Citizenship Education programmes, including Service Learning
and Student-Initiated Projects.</p>
<p>A strong caring culture fosters shared responsibility in nurturing thinking,
resilient, and compassionate leaders. Students develop through leadership
camps, mentoring, life skills programmes, and local and international service-learning
experiences. Under MSLO, J1 students focus on self-awareness and relationships,
while J2 students take on greater leadership roles.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Development</strong>
</p>
<p>Leadership development in NYJC is grounded in the belief in service leadership
- developing leaders who serve both the college and the wider community.</p>
<p>The College focuses on six key leadership competencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Communicating with confidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategising well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Influencing others positively&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Leadership training is conducted at three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>General student population</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class committee members</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CCA leaders and student councillors</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The integrated leadership development programme is jointly supported by:</p>
<ul>

<p>Student Development Department</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PE and CCA Department</p>
</li>

</ul>
<p>NYJC&nbsp; adopts a two-pronged approach:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Career &amp; Education Guidance</strong>
</p>
<p>College life goes beyond preparation for the GCE ‘A’ Level examinations.
The Career Guidance Programme equips students with the knowledge and skills
needed for higher education and the working world.</p>
<p>The programme includes:</p>
