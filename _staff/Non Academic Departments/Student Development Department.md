<p>The programmes that the department has put in place are in line with the
college’s vision of nurturing the leadership potential in every NYJCian.
We also strongly believe in service leadership, encouraging NYJCians to
serve the wider community beyond the college.</p>
<p>Leadership training takes place at 3 levels : the general student population,
the class committee, the CCA leaders and student councillors.</p>
<p>3 departments, namely the Student Leadership Department, CCA Department
and the Student Well-being Department look into the integrated leadership
development programme in Nanyang.</p>
<p><strong>MSLO Framework</strong>
<br>The framework that we are adopting is the Managing Self &amp; Leading
Others framework. Essentially in J1, students will understand and learn
more about themselves and how they relate to each other. In J2, students
will be given opportunities to lead others either in CCA or class projects.</p>
<p><strong>The Approach</strong>
<br>The approach is 2-fold :</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Providing skills training and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing opportunities to lead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Skills training is conducted through the formal curriculum courses, workshops
and civics programmes where basic leadership skills are taught and the
informal curriculum where students can learn from many varied activities
such as camps as well as sharing by successful entrepreneurs and civil
servants.</p>
<p>Many opportunities are provided for students to lead. Class leaders are
given opportunities to act as facilitators in leadership camps organized
by college or secondary schools in the cluster. We also encourage students
to initiate projects to improve the college community.</p>
<p>We believe in fostering the spirit of caring for the community beyond
the college as well. We do our part for the community by being actively
involved in fund raising activities of organizations in need as well as
our partners – Tong Chai Medical Institution and Lions Befrienders.</p>
<p>Each year, we also sent student volunteers on overseas community service
projects to instill in students a sense of civic responsibility through
helping needy communities abroad.</p>
<p>“The very best leaders spend time examining what they have done and are
planning to do.” To complete the cycle of learning, we encourage students
to consciously reflect on the various experiences gathered from workshops,
projects and community involvement. Students are encouraged to keep a portfolio
to record these experiences and to meet regularly with tutors who will
monitor their development.</p>
