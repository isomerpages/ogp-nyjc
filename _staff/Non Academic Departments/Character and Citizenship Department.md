<p><strong>Life Skills Education</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Life Skills Programme supports students’ social-emotional development
and is aligned with MOE’s 21st Century Competencies (21CC). It guides students
to manage themselves effectively, build healthy and respectful relationships,
and navigate diverse life situations with confidence, resilience and sound
values.</p>
<p>These competencies are developed through purposeful learning experiences
that are responsive to students’ needs, including Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) lessons, targeted workshops informed by students’ learning
needs, and other structured programmes that provide authentic contexts
for reflection, practice and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The College focuses on six key life skills areas:</p>

<p>The school counsellor may be found in her office, located in the Media-Resource
Library; or you may contact her at 6-380-5174. She would be available from
9am to 3pm, but should you require an earlier or later appointment, it
can be arranged. You may choose to speak with her face-to-face or through
e-mail.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, counselling is not only for individuals with
severe mental or emotional problems. In fact, most of the students seeking
counselling are able to cope in most areas of their life, except for the
one or two difficult areas they might need help with, such as managing
time better, dealing with test anxiety, working at struggles with communication
or assertiveness, managing anger and relationships better. Counselling
offers you an opportunity to explore the issue and to find strategies to
help you cope better so that you may achieve your goals in life.</p>
<p>The things that you tell your counsellor are subject to a strict code
of confidentiality, and your counsellor will not reveal these to anyone
without your permission. There are, however, a few limits to confidentiality,
such as when the counsellor finds that your life is in danger. There are
times when you might need to seek help from a 24-hour hotline. These are
some hotline numbers you may call.</p>
