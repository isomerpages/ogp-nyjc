<p><strong>Life Skills Education</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Life Skills Programme supports students’ social-emotional development
and is aligned with MOE’s 21st Century Competencies (21CC). It guides students
to manage themselves effectively, build healthy and respectful relationships,
and navigate diverse life situations with confidence, resilience and sound
values.</p>
<p>These competencies are developed through purposeful learning experiences
that are responsive to students’ needs, including Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) lessons, targeted workshops informed by students’ learning
needs, and other structured programmes that provide authentic contexts
for reflection, practice and growth.&nbsp;</p>
