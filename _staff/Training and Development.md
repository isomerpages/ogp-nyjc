<p><strong>Teaching and Learning Matters</strong>
</p>
<p>Teaching and Learning is serious business in NYJC. The sessions we hold
to elicit feedback from our students, coupled with the regular reviewing
and updating of materials based on our awareness of trends, ensure that
our teaching practitioners are always on top of their game. This can only
spell good news for you, the student.</p>

<p>The NYJC Senior Teachers (NYST) play a significant role in providing professional
development opportunities and encouraging teachers to keep abreast with
trends and developments in education. In 2013, the NYST started a blog
to share interesting articles related to education. They also set up a
Facebook page to give quick summary and updates of new articles that are
posted to the blog.</p>
