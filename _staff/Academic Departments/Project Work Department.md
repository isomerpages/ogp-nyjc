<p>Project Work (PW) is a compulsory examinable H1 subject read by all JC
1 students.</p>
<p>PW is a learning experience which aims to provide students with the opportunity
to synthesise knowledge from various areas of learning, and critically
and creatively apply it to real life situations. This process enhances
students’ knowledge and enables them to acquire skills like collaboration,
communication and independent learning, preparing them for lifelong learning
and the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>The PW cycle begins with the release of project tasks in March and ends
with the Oral Presentation Exam in Nov.</p>
