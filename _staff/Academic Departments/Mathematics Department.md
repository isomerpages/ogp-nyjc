<br><strong><a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2025-a-level-syllabus/8865_y25_sy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">H1 Mathematics 8865 (Revised)</a></strong> 
<br>
<br>Students without O-Level Additional Mathematics can consider this subject
because it offers an opportunity for them to learn important mathematical
concepts and skills in algebra and calculus that are taught in Additional
Mathematics. Students will also learn basic statistical methods that are
necessary for studies in business and social sciences.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2025-a-level-syllabus/9758_y25_sy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">H2 Mathematics 9758 (Revised)</a></strong><em> </em>
<br>
<br>This subject prepares students for a range of university courses, including
mathematics, sciences, engineering and related courses, where a good foundation
in mathematics is required. It develops mathematical thinking and reasoning
skills that are essential for further learning of mathematics. This subject
assumes the knowledge of O-Level Additional Mathematics.</p>
