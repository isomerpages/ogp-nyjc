<p>The Mathematics Department is in charge of the following subjects:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2021syllabus/8865_y21_sy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>H1 Mathematics 8865</strong></a></p>
<p>Students without O-Level Additional Mathematics can consider this subject because it offers an opportunity for them to learn important mathematical concepts and skills in algebra and calculus that are taught in Additional Mathematics. Students will also learn basic statistical methods that are necessary for studies in business and social sciences.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2021syllabus/9758_y21_sy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H2 Mathematics&nbsp;9758&nbsp;</a></strong></p>
<p>This subject prepares students for a range of university courses, including mathematics, sciences, engineering and related courses, where a good foundation in mathematics is required. It develops mathematical thinking and reasoning skills that are essential for further learning of mathematics. This subject assumes the knowledge of O-Level Additional Mathematics.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2021syllabus/9649_y21_sy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H2 Further Mathematics&nbsp;9649&nbsp;</a></strong></p>
<p>This subject must be taken together with H2 Mathematics.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2021syllabus/9820_y21_sy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H3 Mathematics 9820&nbsp;</a></strong></p>
<p>This subject must be taken together with H2 Mathematics and is only offered in the second year to students who have performed outstandingly well in H2 Mathematics.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2021syllabus/9569_y21_sy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H2 Computing 9569&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></strong></p>
