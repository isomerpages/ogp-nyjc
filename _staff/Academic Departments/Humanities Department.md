<p>Nanyang JC offers the Art Elective Programme (AEP). Our art programme
places equal emphasis on the practical and theoretical aspects of art making,
encouraging students to explore their thoughts, feelings and ideas through
a variety of art practices and processes.</p>
<p>In JC1, the AEP students will go through a series of modules, exposing
them to different types of art making, for example, drawing, painting,
photography, sculpture, design, and video.&nbsp;&nbsp;In JC2, the AEP students
will embark on their ‘A’ Level coursework for 9 months, choosing their
own area of specialisation. During this time, students will be guided personally
by their tutors.</p>
<p>The students in the programme can also look forward to exciting combined-schools
art workshops, artists’ talks, competitions and learning journeys. They
will also have the chance to go on an overseas art immersion trip to broaden
their exposure and deepen their engagement with art.</p>
<p>All students interested to study Art are required to sit for a Drawing
&amp; Painting Test and a Written Test administered by the AEP teachers
to asses their aptitude for the course. Students are also required to attend
an interview and present their portfolio. Upon successful admission to
the course, students will be automatically placed in the Art Elective Programme.</p>
