Nanyang JC offers the Art Elective Programme (AEP). Our art programme places equal emphasis on the practical and theoretical aspects of art making, encouraging students to explore their thoughts, feelings and ideas through a variety of art practices and processes.

In JC1, the AEP students will go through a series of modules, exposing them to different types of art making, for example, drawing, painting, photography, sculpture, design, and video.  In JC2, the AEP students will embark on their ‘A’ Level coursework for 9 months, choosing their own area of specialisation. During this time, students will be guided personally by their tutors.

The students in the programme can also look forward to exciting combined-schools art workshops, artists’ talks, competitions and learning journeys. They will also have the chance to go on an overseas art immersion trip to broaden their exposure and deepen their engagement with art.

All students interested to study Art are required to sit for a Drawing & Painting Test and a Written Test administered by the AEP teachers to assess their aptitude for the course. Students are also required to attend an interview and present their portfolio. Upon successful admission to the course, students will be automatically placed in the Art Elective Programme.
