General Paper

General Paper is an H1 subject and is compulsory for all students. The department prepares students for two papers: Paper 1 which requires students to write an essay from a wide selection of questions and Paper 2 which is a test of students’ comprehension of given passages. The papers are taken consecutively and each paper lasts for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
General Paper is not a mere continuation of the English Language paper students sat for at the GCE ‘O’ level. Also, it is not a mere test of general knowledge. It aims to help students understand the world by developing in them a critical mind and sensitivity towards change and continuity in the human experience. It is therefore not confined to a textbook. The course is designed to acquaint students with significant issues in the political and social realms, scientific progress and its effects on human life, and the arts and their relevance.
