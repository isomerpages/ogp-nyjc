<p>General Paper</p>
<p>General Paper is an H1 subject and is compulsory for all students. The
department prepares students for two papers: Paper 1 which requires students
to write an essay from a wide selection of questions and Paper 2 which
is a test of students’ comprehension of given passages. The papers are
taken consecutively and each paper lasts for 1 hour and 30 minutes.</p>
<p>General Paper is not a mere continuation of the English Language paper
students sat for at the GCE ‘O’ level. Also, it is not a mere test of general
knowledge. It aims to help students understand the world by developing
in them a critical mind and sensitivity towards change and continuity in
the human experience. It is therefore not confined to a textbook. The course
is designed to acquaint students with significant issues in the political
and social realms, scientific progress and its effects on human life, and
the arts and their relevance.</p>
