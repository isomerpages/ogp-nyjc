<p>The motto of ODAC is “<strong>Challenge the limits</strong>”. This motto,
in essence, is the indomitable spirit of the NYJC Outdoor Adventure Club.</p>
<p>NYJC ODAC, as its name suggests, offers a wide array of outdoor adventure
activities. These include, but are not limited to, activities such as camping,
outdoor cooking, tent pitching, abseiling, cycling, and hiking. ODAC provides
its members with the opportunity to become intrepid adventurers, preparing
them for their next feat of strength and skill.</p>
<p>The members push themselves to reach greater heights, motivating one another
to achieve the same goal – whether it is swimming, running or scaling a
wall.</p>
<p>The resilience and perseverance developed in ODAC are not only applicable
to outdoor challenges but also to academic pursuits and everyday life.
The satisfaction of reaching the peak of a mountain mirrors the rewards
of hard work in a test or examination. Just as members learn to endure
physical challenges, they apply the same determination and mindset to navigate
the intensity of the ‘A’ level course and the demands of daily life.</p>
