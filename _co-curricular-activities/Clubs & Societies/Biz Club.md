<p><u>‘To Ignite, To Inspire, To Innovate‘</u>
</p>
<p>Established in 2004, NYJC Biz Club is a vibrant community that nurtures
entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovative thinking and stands as a dynamic
hub where entrepreneurial spirit meets real-world business experience.
As a participating school in the Junior Achievement (JA) Singapore's Company
Program, we provide our members with a unique opportunity to learn from
industry mentors and gain hands-on experience in starting and running their
own companies and gain valuable insights into the world of business and
entrepreneurship. Through partnerships with leading organizations like
Bloomberg, members develop essential professional skills including CV writing,
presentation techniques, and LinkedIn optimisation. Our active participation
in prestigious competitions - from the JA Singapore Company of the Year
Competition to the NTU Materials Innovation Challenge - provides invaluable
real-world experience for them.</p>
<p>Through these interactive workshops, hands-on projects, and competitions,
our members develop essential life skills, including:</p>
<p>Resilience and adaptability: Learning from failures and setbacks, our
members grow into confident and agile individuals.</p>
<p>Collaboration and teamwork: By working together on projects and competitions,
our members foster strong relationships and develop effective communication
skills.</p>
<p>Creative problem-solving and innovation: We encourage our members to think
outside the box, challenge assumptions, and develop innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurial mindset and risk-taking: Our members learn to identify
opportunities, assess risks, and develop strategic plans to achieve their
goals.</p>
<p>Through our weekly meetings and activities, our members become empowered
with the skills, knowledge, and values necessary to succeed in an ever-changing
world. They have also sought to empower their friends in college by organising
various finance-related exhibitions such as a CPF Carnival, to help their
peers learn more about good financial literacy.</p>
<p>In NYJC Biz Club, students don't just learn about business – they experience
it. From STEM career sharing sessions with MIT alumni to participation
in the NUS Connect Startathon, our diverse calendar ensures members stay
at the forefront of business innovation while developing the skills needed
for future success. By joining NYJC Biz Club, students can unlock their
full potential, develop a growth mindset, and become the leaders of tomorrow.</p>
