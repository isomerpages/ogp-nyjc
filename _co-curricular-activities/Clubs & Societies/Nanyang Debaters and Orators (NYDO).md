The Nanyang Debaters and Orators (NYDO) commits itself to encouraging NYJCians to think critically and communicate effectively.  It strives to engage in discourse within the college, serving as a platform for students to voice their opinions. The Recreational Wing works hard to organise exhibition debates, dialogue sessions and talks to bring to attention of NYJCians, important socio-political issues.  

Besides organising events within the college to engage their college mates, the Competitive Wing also actively participates in friendly spars and competitions, such as the  Oldham Cup and MOE Intercollegiate Debate Competition (MIDC), YMCA Plain English Speaking Award (PESA), Singapore Model Cabinet (SMC) and Preparatory Model United Nations (PREPMUN) Conference. However, NYDO also believes that debating and public speaking should not only be open to those with experience. They welcome NYJCians of any skill level to join them on Team Infernus.

CCA sessions are held twice a week on Tuesdays and Wednesdays where they endeavour to live up to their motto, ‘ARTE ET MARTE’, by honing our oratorical skills and logical reasoning.
