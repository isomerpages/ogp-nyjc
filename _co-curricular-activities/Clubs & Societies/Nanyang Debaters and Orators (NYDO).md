<p>At the heart of the Nanyang Debaters and Orators (NYDO) is a commitment
to ignite critical thinking and hone persuasive communication among NYJCians.
By creating a vibrant space for discourse, NYDO empowers students to speak
confidently, analyse assumptions, and broaden their perspectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guided by the motto, ‘ARTE ET MARTE’—‘Skill and Valour’, NYDO sessions
go beyond imparting confidence in debate and public speaking techniques.
They also give members the courage to push their own boundaries and rise
to intellectual challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within NYJC, NYDO organises events such as NY Model United Nations and
exhibition debates, igniting lively discussions on socio-political issues.
Beyond these on-campus initiatives, the Competitive Wing embraces friendly
spars and prestigious competitions, such as the MOE Intercollegiate Debate
Competition (MIDC), YMCA Plain English Speaking Award (PESA),and Model
United Nation conferences. Contributing to the wider debating community,
NYDO organises their very own Infernus Cup, a debate competition for novice
debaters who would otherwise have limited competitive debating opportunities.</p>
