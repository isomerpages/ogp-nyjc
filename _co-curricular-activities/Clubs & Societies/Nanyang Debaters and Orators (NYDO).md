<p>At the heart of the Nanyang Debaters and Orators (NYDO) is a commitment
to ignite critical thinking and hone persuasive communication among NYJCians.
By creating a vibrant space for discourse, NYDO empowers students to speak
their minds, question assumptions, and broaden their perspectives.</p>
<p>Guided by the motto, ‘ARTE ET MARTE,’—‘Skill and Valour’, NYDO sessions
go beyond imparting debate and public speaking techniques. They also give
members the confidence to push their own boundaries and rise to intellectual
challenges.</p>
<p>Within NYJC, NYDO organises events such as NY Model United Nations and
exhibition debates, igniting lively conversations on pressing socio-political
issues. Beyond these on-campus initiatives, the Competitive Wing embraces
friendly spars and prestigious competitions, such as the MOE Intercollegiate
Debate Competition (MIDC), YMCA Plain English Speaking Award (PESA),and
Model United Nation conferences. Contributing to the wider debating community,
NYDO organises their very own Infernus Cup, a debate competition for novice
debaters who would otherwise have limited competitive debating opportunities.</p>
<p>NYDO believes everyone can benefit from mastering the art of debate and
public speaking. Whether you are a seasoned speaker or brand-new to the
craft, all are invited to join NYDO, where you will strengthen your oratorical
skills, sharpen your reasoning, and grow into a confident communicator.</p>
