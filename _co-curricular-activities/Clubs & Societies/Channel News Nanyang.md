<p><strong><em>We Film. We Edit. We Report.</em></strong><br /><br />Channel News Nanyang (CNNY) reports school events and broadcasts them via the college&rsquo;s TV Broadcast System. The news clips are on YouTube as well. In the process of news-making, the students will not only get to learn the technical aspects of filming but also the art of it &ndash; in the form of editing, scripting, reporting and the management of logistics.</p>
<p>Members meet on Wednesdays, from 3pm to 5pm.</p>
<p>CNNY is the place to start your journalistic/film-making dream.</p>
