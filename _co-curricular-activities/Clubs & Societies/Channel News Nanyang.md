<p>Channel News Nanyang is where creativity meets collaboration. Members
gain hands-on experience producing a range of video content – from covering
college events to competing in short-form video competitions such as <em>Our Schools, Our Stories Photo and Video Contest </em>and<em> Appreciating NSmen Video Competition, </em>among
others. Beyond production, members go on learning journeys organised by
the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), including visits to <em>TheSmartLocal</em>,
where they pick up tips from professional creators. From every shot to
every edit, our members are the ones sharing the Nanyang story.</p>
<p>Members meet on Wednesdays, from 3pm to 5pm.</p>
