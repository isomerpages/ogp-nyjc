<p>Red Cross Youth (RCY) is an important and necessary club. Staying true
to our motto ‘Selfless we are, the difference we make’, we take pride in
serving the college as an ever-ready first aid team.</p>
<p>Besides rendering first aid services to the college, we collaborate with
The Singapore Red Cross Society to organise college-based blood donation
drives and conduct life skills workshops where we teach our college mates
basic first aid skills. We are also actively involved in Values-in-Action
projects, including the First Aiders on Wheels at East Coast Park.</p>
<p>All members will go through Standard First Aid Training conducted by trainers
from the Red Cross Headquarters to be certified as first aiders.</p>
<p>We conduct our CCA sessions every Wednesday A from 3pm to 5pm and Wednesday
B from 1pm to 3pm.</p>
