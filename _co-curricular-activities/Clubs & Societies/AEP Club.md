The AEP Club is one of NYJCâ€™s niche CCAs where students from the Art Elective Programme deepen their passion for art and excel in their craft.

In addition to learning different crafts through various in-house workshops, the club conducts regular visits to art exhibitions, learning journeys to museums and galleries as well as encourages active participation in art competitions throughout the year. The club members also organize enrichment activities and workshops for their fellow NYJCians and for their community.

The AEP Club meets on Wednesdays, from 3pm to 6pm. The members value these sessions as opportunities to showcase their creativity and also a time to interact and share their knowledge and interests with other art lovers.
