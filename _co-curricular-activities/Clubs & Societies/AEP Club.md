<p>The AEP Club provides enriched art experiences for students with both
artistic aptitude and a passion for the arts. In addition to learning various
crafts through in-house workshops, the club organises learning journeys
to museums and galleries and encourages active participation in art competitions.
Members also take the initiative to organise enrichment activities and
workshops for their fellow NYJCians and the wider community.</p>
<p>The AEP Club meets on Wednesdays, and members greatly value these sessions
as opportunities to connect, collaborate, and share their knowledge and
enthusiasm with other art lovers.</p>
