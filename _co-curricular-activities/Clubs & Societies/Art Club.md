<p>The Art Club provides enriching experiences for students passionate about
the visual arts. In addition to learning various art techniques through
in-house workshops, the club organises learning journeys to museums and
galleries, and encourages active participation in art competitions. Members
also organise student-initiated activities and events for their fellow
NYJCians and the wider community, honing various skills such as leadership
and teamwork. Over the years, the club has contributed to many college
events, such as Racial Harmony Day Celebration, CarNYval festival, and
the SG60 Mural Painting project, demonstrating their artistic potential
and commitment to the college and community.</p>
<p>The Art Club meets on Wednesday afternoons to connect, collaborate and
share knowledge and enthusiasm with fellow art enthusiasts.</p>
