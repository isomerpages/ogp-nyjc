<p>The NYJC library is known as The Drum. It is a student-centred organisation that aims to invigorate the reading scene and to inspire the sharing of knowledge and experiences.<br class="" /><br class="" />The Drummers (NYJC student librarians), besides taking care of basic library duties such as the normal housekeeping of the library, also go on book-buying trips to continually stock The Drum with the latest books.<br class="" /><br class="" />Beyond the basics, however, The Drum strives to be a hub of activities that engage the student body, with events organized all year round. Past major events include&nbsp;<strong class=""><em class="">MYSTERY 240, NIGHTLIGHT, TELEFIESTA and SPORTS FANTASIA</em></strong>. Throughout the year, minor events are initiated as well to create a constant buzz at the Drum. From monthly quizzes like Magazine Word Search to The Drum&rsquo;s very own Monthly Movie Screening and flea markets, drummers get to exercise their creativity in proposing and initiating new ideas to put forth to the student population.</p>
