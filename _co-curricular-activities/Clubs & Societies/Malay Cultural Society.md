The Malay Cultural Society (MCS) provides a platform for its members to showcase and develop their talents and skills in the performing arts and language arts. Members also develop their leadership and organisation skills through organisation of various student-initiated projects.

In addition, MCS members also participate in cultural camps, inter-college competitions, language & cultural workshops to better appreciate the Malay language and culture.

Weekly meetings are conducted on Wednesdays, 3pm to 6pm.
