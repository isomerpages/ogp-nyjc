<p>The NYJC Chinese Cultural Society (CCS) provides a platform for students
to explore and express their passion for Chinese theatre performing arts.
Guided by a professional instructor renowned in Singapore's theatre industry,
members of CCS gain valuable insights into theatre practices and have the
opportunity to engage with both local and international drama productions.</p>
<p>The weekly drama lessons are put to practical test as CCS members collaborate
on their annual Chinese drama production, 《我们的白云岗》. This production not
only provides aspiring actors and actresses the opportunity to showcase
their talents on stage but also offers in-depth learning experiences in
stage design, sound and lighting control, as well as props and costume
design.</p>
<p>If you share a passion for theatre arts, join the CCS family and be part
of an exciting and creative journey!</p>
