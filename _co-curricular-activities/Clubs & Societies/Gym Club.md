<p>The Gym Club was established in 2013 with the aim of promoting a culture
of fitness and holistic well-being within Nanyang Junior College. The Club
adopts innovative and engaging approaches to encourage students to lead
active and healthy lifestyles.</p>
<p>Club members train together regularly to improve their physical fitness,
while also exchanging ideas, tips, and strategies related to exercise and
nutrition. The Club also places strong emphasis on camaraderie and teamwork,
providing bonding opportunities through shared fitness experiences such
as cycling excursions and rock climbing activities, which strengthen friendships
and foster a supportive club culture.</p>
<p>Beyond personal fitness, the Gym Club is actively involved in Values-in-Action
(VIA) initiatives that leverage fitness as a means of serving the community.
Members engage beneficiaries from organisations such as MINDS, encouraging
them to be more physically active through guided workouts and inclusive
fitness activities. The Club also participates in runs that support meaningful
causes, including the Yellow Ribbon Run and the Skechers Friendship Walk,
reinforcing values of social responsibility and community support.</p>
<p>In addition, the Gym Club has participated in external fitness competitions,
providing members with platforms to challenge themselves and develop resilience,
teamwork, and discipline. Notably, the Club participated in the E.W. Barker
Challenge conducted by the National Institute of Education (NIE) in 2025,
where they emerged as Champions. Through these experiences, the Gym Club
cultivates a strong sense of sportsmanship while inspiring the wider student
community to embrace active living.</p>
