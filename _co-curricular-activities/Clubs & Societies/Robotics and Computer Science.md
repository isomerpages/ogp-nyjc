<p><em>“Strive to Excel, Drive with Passion”</em>
</p>
<p>With its humble beginnings in 2005 as the Nanyang Robotics Club, the club
has grown over the years, adapting to current tech trends to equip members
with STEM-related skill sets that are highly sought after today. The club
offers members with three specializations: Robotics, Cybersecurity, and
Competitive Programming, allowing them to explore in-depth knowledge and
hone their skills in their chosen fields.</p>
<p>At the Nanyang Robotics and Computer Science Club, we believe that the
best way to learn is by teaching. Therefore, we adopt a peer-teaching and
self-directed learning approach, where experienced members share their
skills and knowledge while others learn through practice with a wide variety
of problems and challenges. This fosters a supportive environment that
encourages members to further develop and refine their STEM skills, pushing
them toward greater proficiency.</p>
<p>The club has excelled in various prestigious events such as <em>The Singapore Robotic Games</em>, <em>The Robo Grand Prix</em>,
and <em>The National Junior Robotic Competition (NJRC)</em>. Since its establishment,
the club has consistently secured top prizes in competitions. To date,
the club has achieved nine championships and thirteen first runner-up titles
in less than eight years of its history. Notably, in 2013, the club was
ranked third globally in the high school category at the <em>VEX Robotics Skills 2013</em> competition
and was invited to represent Singapore in the final round held in the United
States. Additionally, the club secured second place in NJRC's Best Robot
Performance in the tertiary category. Members have also excelled in local
Competitive Programming competitions, with two members clinching silver
awards at the <em>National Olympiad in Informatics 2024</em>.</p>
<p>The club welcomes students who are independent learners with self initiative,
passionate about robotics programming and enjoy solving challenging programming
problems in computer science.</p>
