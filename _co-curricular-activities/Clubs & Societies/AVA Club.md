The AVA Club is a very important set-up in NYJC. The crew is responsible for the smooth running of the daily morning assemblies and every concert and programme that requires the support of audio visual aid. Where there are lights and sound, the AVA crew will be there.

AVA crew members are known for their ability to stay cool under pressure.  They are sharp observers, keen problem-solvers and excellent team players. The AVA Club opens its doors to everyone – whether you are a veteran or one who cannot tell one wire from another – training will be provided and you will be the key to a successful performance in no time.
