<p>Supported by the Rotary Club of Tanglin, Interact Club creates opportunities
for NYJCians to participate in meaningful and fun service-learning projects.
The goal is to serve and meet the needs of the community with empathy and
goodwill. In addition, Interactors (i.e., members of Interact Club) will
be able to hone their interpersonal skills, leadership capabilities, build
their resilience, and sharpen their resourcefulness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Interactors participate in 5 local core projects, each uniquely designed
to serve different community groups. Under Project Care, the Interactors
create enriching activities for preschoolers. Project Silver Friends and
Project Sphere cater to the needs of the elderly, while the Interactors
in Project Zeal engage with patients from the Institute of Mental Health.
The Community Leadership Programme provides the Interactors with the opportunity
to engage the residents of Braddell Heights.</p>
<p>The Interactors also organise ad-hoc activities to broaden their service-learning
experiences. These activities include preparing and packing food for Willing
Hearts which delivers free meals to low-income households.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>If you believe in “Service above Self”, do not hesitate to join the Interact Club in this life-changing journey!</em>
