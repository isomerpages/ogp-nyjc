**Building young women up to be driven, powerful, quick-thinking and resilient team players.**

The NYJC Touch Rugby encourages a fun, safe space for girls to experience and learn values such as resourcefulness, resilience, confidence, athleticism, teamwork and cohesion.

The game of touch rugby is derived from rugby football in which the tackling of opposing players is replaced by a touch. As touches must be made with minimal force, touch rugby is therefore a limited-contact sport.

The NYJC Touch Rugby team trains hard every Tuesday and Thursday from 5-7pm on the college field and participates in various competitions and tournaments. Training consists of skills, field tactics and physical fitness. Besides training hard together, the team often organises study sessions to ensure that every team player develops their full potential both on and off the field.

No experience in this sport is required. If you have a sports background, it will be easier for you to pick up the skills. If you are just an energetic girl who would like to experience the exhilarating feeling of running around the open field, scoring a try and learning a new sport, touch rugby is the CCA for you!
