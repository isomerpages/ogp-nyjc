Badminton, a whole new dimension of excitement and fun, keeping players fit as they chase after a single shuttlecock everywhere around the court!

The NYJC Badminton Team trains twice a week – Tuesday and Thursday – with additional training sessions before any tournament. Court training sessions take place from 5.30 to 7.30pm and involve footwork, drills and improvement of players’ technical skills. Physical training sessions follow after, from 7.30 to 8 pm. We take part in various competitions such as the National Schools ‘A’ Division Championships and the Pilot Pen Cup and we also organise friendly matches. Through all these activities, we gain exposure to a wide range of game play and learn the styles adopted by others, thereby helping us become better players.

However, the NYJC Badminton Team isn’t all about hard work alone. We also make short trips to places such as Malaysia where we learn and train with players outside of Singapore. The experience of playing together and learning from one another not only strengthens the bond among members of our team but also instills the values of diligence, perseverance and excellence in each of us
