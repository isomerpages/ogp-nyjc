<p>Squash originated from England more than a century ago and is a racket
and ball sport played by two players in a four-walled court with a small,
hollow rubber ball. It is currently played at various levels across the
world, from amateur games played at community courts to the prestigious
World Tour league organised by the Professional Squash Association. It
is a fast and physical game, and players stand to acquire excellent hand-eye
coordination, speed, flexibility and stamina.</p>
<p>The NYJC Squash team trains every Monday from 5pm to 7pm and Wednesday
from 3pm to 7pm during term time. Our training consists of various drills
to improve one’s footwork and precision when hitting the ball and also
regular physical training to build up the stamina required to complete
3 to 5 sets of games during competitions. Friendly matches with other schools
are also regularly held to hone our skills and broaden our playing experience.
The best amongst the team are chosen to represent the college in the National
School Games. Our coach is Mr. Tommy Tan, an experienced coach who has
many years of coaching experience, on top of being a premier grade player
in the country’s national league, and is also a World Squash Federation
Level 1 Coach, as well as Singapore Coach Excellence Level 1.</p>
