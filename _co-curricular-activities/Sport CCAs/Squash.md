Squash originated from England more than a century ago and is a racket and ball sport played by two players in a four-walled court with a small, hollow rubber ball. It is an individual sport rather than a team sport and you will need excellent hand-eye coordination, speed, flexibility and stamina to excel in this sport.

The NYJC Squash team trains every Monday and Friday from 5pm to 7pm and Wednesday from 3pm to 5pm during term time. Our training consists of various drills to improve oneâ€™s footwork and precision when hitting the ball and also regular physical training to build up the stamina required to complete 3 to 5 sets of games during competitions. Friendly matches with other schools are held to hone our skills and broaden our playing experience. Our coach is Mr. Rhamanan, a distinguished ex-national player and very experienced coach who has been coaching for decades.

If you are looking for a challenging and fast-paced sport that requires lightning speed reflexes (both physically and mentally), come and join squash!
