<p>Tennis is a dynamic sport that can be played either as singles—between
two players — or doubles, involving two teams of two players each. While
it is often seen as an individual pursuit, tennis thrives on teamwork and
camaraderie. In truth, tennis is as much about individual skill as it is
about team spirit, as both are essential for a player to reach their fullest
potential. It is a game that demands physical strength, mental endurance,
and strategic thinking.</p>
