Tennis is a sport played either between two players (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). A common misconception is that Tennis is an individual sport. In reality, it is a team sport. Team work and team spirit are essential in helping a tennis player reach his/her fullest potential. It is a game that requires physical as well as mental endurance. In Nanyang Junior College, no prior experience is required before joining the Tennis team.

Team court training sessions are held on Tuesdays from 5.30pm to 8pm and Wednesdays from 3pm to 6.30pm. Besides the National School Games ‘A’ Division championships, our team also takes part in friendly matches. Through these matches, we learn by reviewing our play and by observing our opponents, enabling us to grow into better Tennis players.

We also have an annual Tennis Camp that aims to prepare our players for the National School Games Championships. During the camp, we undergo physical training and court training to strengthen our physical endurance, mental resilience, and technical and tactical skills.
