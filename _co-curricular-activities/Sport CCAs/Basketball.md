<p>Basketball is a game of 100% focus, teamwork, agility and accuracy with
two competing teams pitting against each other to win the game.</p>
<p>Led by Coach Andre Wong, the NYJC basketball team trains every Monday
and Thursday for the boys and Tuesday and Friday for the girls, from 5pm
– 7pm. Under the strict supervision of Coach Wong, we train hard and participate
in the National School Games `A’ Division Championship every year and strive
for the best results.</p>
<p>Though basketball may seem like a simple game of scoring baskets, the
effort required to play the sport on a competitive level as a team is beyond
simple. Through the tough training sessions, we grow and improve as a team,
learn to trust each other, overcome any obstacles hindering our progress
and develop the chemistry between each and every one of us – in short,
becoming a family. You will never truly understand the sense of accomplishment
of fighting alongside your teammates on the court unless you participate
in this sport.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Come join NYJC basketball and embark on this
journey with us!</p>
<p>“Join us as teammates, leave as family!”</p>
