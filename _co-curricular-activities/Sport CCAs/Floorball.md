<p>Floorball is an indoor sport which originated from Sweden and has gained
popularity in countries like Australia, Canada, Japan, the United States,
Germany, and Singapore in recent years. It demands a high level of physical
fitness and mental fortitude from its participants and is a game that requires
a high level of commitment and patience to master the basics. Since its
infancy as a Student Initiated Program (SIG), NY Floorball has come a long
way; it has been inaugurated as an official CCA of our college, and members
of the NY Floorball Team, both past and present, are known for their high
level of fitness, determination, and resourcefulness.</p>
<p>The team currently trains twice a week (Wednesdays and Fridays) and has
the privilege of being coached by Mr. Nahendran s/o Alagappan – an exceptional
coach who places great emphasis on student-centric initiatives like character
development, mastering the basics of the game, developing responsible habits
both on and off the court, and more.</p>
<p>The team participates in the Annual ‘A’ Division Tournament and also engages
in friendly matches with other schools.</p>
