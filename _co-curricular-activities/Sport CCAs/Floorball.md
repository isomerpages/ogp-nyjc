Floorball is an indoor sport which originated from Sweden and has gained popularity in countries like Australia, Canada, Japan, United States, Germany and Singapore in recent years. It demands a high level of physical fitness and mental fortitude from its participants and is a game that requires a high level of commitment and patience to master the basics. Since its infancy as a Student Initiated Program (SIG), NY Floorball has come a long way; it has been inaugurated as an official CCA of our college and members of the NY Floorball Team, both past and present, are known for their high level of fitness, determination and resourcefulness.

The team currently trains three times a week (Mondays, 4.30pm - 6.30pm; Wednesdays, 2.30pm - 6.30pm and Fridays, 4.30pm - 6.30pm) and have the privilege of being coached by Ms Lisa Ong - an exceptional coach who places great emphasis on student-centric initiatives like character development, mastering the basics of the game, developing responsible habits both on and off the court and the like. 

The team participates in the Annual ‘A’ Division Tournament and also, in friendly matches with other schools.
