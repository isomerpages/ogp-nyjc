<p><strong>Imagine. You. Dragonboat.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="">Imagine: the wind in your hair, water splashing against your face, as you row at speeds of up to 12km/h and beyond. This is Dragon boat Racing. Dragon boat is one of a family of traditional long boats found throughout Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands. It is now used in the team&nbsp;</span><span class=""><a class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddling">paddling sport&nbsp;</a></span><span class="">of dragon boat racing.</span><span class="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">This CCA encompasses the values of teamwork and discipline, forging camaraderie between the members in the team. These team mates become your extended family throughout JC and very often, beyond that as well. Be it sorrow or joy, you will always find someone to share it with. You may come across trials during your journey but your team mates will be facing them with you.&nbsp; Awards are the mere bonuses you get; the true treasures are the friends that you would make during your time in Dragon boat.</span></p>
