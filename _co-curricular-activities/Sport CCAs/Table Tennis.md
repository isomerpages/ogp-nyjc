Table Tennis is a niche sport in the college. The college’s Table Tennis Teams have consistently attained remarkable results in the National Inter-School ‘A’ Division Table Tennis Championships. Both the boys’ and girls’ teams have been placed in the top 4 positions since 2007. We attribute our success to the hard work put in by our passionate players, our dedicated coach, and committed teachers-in-charge.

Table Tennis is a game that demands exquisite skills, good reflexes, quick thinking, resilience, mental toughness, self-control and patience. We aim to develop these qualities in our players and also develop in them a positive attitude and strong character that will help them succeed in their future endeavours.
