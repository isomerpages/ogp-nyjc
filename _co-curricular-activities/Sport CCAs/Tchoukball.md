Tchoukball is a sport which emphasises teamwork.

In NYJC, our Tchoukballers live by the motto 'One Team All In' - placing the team’s interest before the players’ own; recognising the importance of having each other’s back, both on and off the court. Despite the rigour involved, the team looks forward to every training session, working together with their teammates and coach to achieve a common goal of attaining victory at the 'A' Division Tchoukball Championships.
