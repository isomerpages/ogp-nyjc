<p>Netball is a team game that requires teamwork, speed and accuracy. Netball
is also a game of discipline as it requires focus and concentration to
perform on court. All in all, it is a fun and exciting game that thrills
and excites both the players and the audience as the outcome is never certain.</p>
<p>The Nanyang netball training sessions take place twice a week, on Tuesday
and Thursday with additional training sessions prior to the National ‘A’
division tournament. Training is from 5pm to 7pm under our coach Ms Saadiah
Khamis, at the school’s Sheltered Court. Apart from the ‘A’ division tournament,
we also take part in leagues such as SGNA Cup, as well as organise friendly
matches with other schools. As a team, we often watch national netball
competitions like Nations Cup together.</p>
<p>If you think you have what it takes, then join netball and get ready for
a whole new playing experience! The netball family welcomes you!</p>
