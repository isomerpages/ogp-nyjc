Netball is a team game that requires teamwork, speed and accuracy.  Netball is also a game of discipline as it requires focus and concentration in order to perform on court. All in all, it is a fun and exciting game that thrills and excites both the players and audience as the outcome is never certain.

The Nanyang netball training sessions take place twice a week, on Tuesday and Thursday with additional training sessions prior to the National ‘A’ division tournament. Training starts from 5.30pm - 7.30pm under our coach Mr Christopher Koh, at the school’s parade square, Apart from the ‘A’ division tournament, we also take part in leagues such as the Daisy Tan Carnival, as well as organise friendly matches with other schools. As a team, we often watch national netball competitions like the Nations Cup together.

If you think you have what it takes, then join netball and get ready for a whole new playing experience! The netball family welcomes you!
