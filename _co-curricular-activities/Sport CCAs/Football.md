<p>Football is more than just the world’s most popular sport; at Nanyang
Junior College (NYJC), it represents teamwork, determination, and a shared
commitment to excellence. The NYJC Football team is proud to embody these
values both on and off the pitch. After all, it is the world’s most popular
sport, appealing to the vast majority, whether young or old.</p>
<p>The team members have had many values instilled in us by our coach, Tan
Sio Beng, and teachers-in-charge. Determination and diligence are the core
values that have helped us tremendously throughout our journey, especially
during the ‘A’ Division matches where competition is extremely high. Over
the years, our team has achieved commendable results in the National School
Games Football Championships:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2015: 2nd</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2016: Quarter Finalists</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2017: 3rd</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2018: 3rd</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2019: 3rd</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2022: Quarter Finalists</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2023: Quarter Finalists</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2024: Quarter Finalists</p>
<p>In addition to these achievements, the football team had the privilege
of participating in cultural exchanges overseas, which provided unique
opportunities for growth and learning beyond the pitch. These exchanges
included trips to Vietnam (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City) and Thailand (Bangkok
and Phuket), where the team experienced different football cultures, built
international friendships, and gained valuable exposure.</p>
<p>Our training is usually held thrice a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays at 5.30pm, but it is reduced during off-season and examination
periods. With the new synthetic field, an excellent facility, the team
members enjoy fruitful training sessions, as well as a good time outside
the classroom.</p>
