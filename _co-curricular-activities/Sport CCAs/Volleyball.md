<p>Volleyball is more than just a sport; at Nanyang Junior College (NYJC),
it is a testament to teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. The NYJC Volleyball
team is a dynamic and closely-knit group that strives to embody these values
on and off the court. Through rigorous training and shared goals, the team
fosters a culture of mutual support and excellence.</p>
<p>The Volleyball team trains three times a week but it is reduced during
off-season and examination periods. We take part in the annual National
School Games ‘A’ Division Volleyball Championships, where both the boys
and girls teams have demonstrated remarkable performances:</p>
