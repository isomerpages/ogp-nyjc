<p>The NYJC Guzheng Ensemble (NYGZ) was established in 2002 with the aim
of promoting traditional Chinese music and nurturing young Guzheng players.
Since its inception, NYGZ has earned high accolades at the Singapore Youth
Festival (SYF), receiving the Gold Award in both 2009 and 2011. From 2013
onwards, the ensemble has consistently been awarded the Certificate of
Distinction at the biennial SYF Arts Presentations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to these accolades, NYGZ holds a biennial concert in collaboration
with the NYJC Chinese Orchestra (CO). The members also have the opportunity
to participate in Music and Cultural Exchange trips, where they can interact
with and learn from other Guzheng players.</p>
<p>Our practices are held on Wednesdays, 3pm – 6pm and Fridays, 5pm – 7pm.</p>
