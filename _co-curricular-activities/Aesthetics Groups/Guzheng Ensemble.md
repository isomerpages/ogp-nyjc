The NYJC Guzheng Ensemble (NYGZ) was established in 2002 with the aim of promoting traditional Chinese music and developing young Guzheng players.

NYGZ has been consistently earning high accolades at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). At the 2013 and 2015 SYF Arts Presentation, it was awarded the Certificate of Distinction for outstanding performance. This is testament to the commitment and effort put in by the entire team under the guidance of our talented and dedicated instructor, Mr Lam Zi Peng (蓝子澎老师) who graduated from the China Conservatory of Music in Beijing.

Apart from SYF Arts Presentation, NYGZ performs in their biennale concert in collaboration with NYJC CO. There are also opportunities for the members to go on Music and Cultural Exchange trips to interact with and learn from other Guzheng players.
