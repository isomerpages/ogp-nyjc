A full theatre experience awaits members of the English Drama Club. Since the early â€˜00s, our annual Drama Night production has changed from short play festivals, to double-bills, and even full length self-written musicals.

Our Instructors have always been selected not only based on their experience in developing youth theatre, but also on their professional experience performing in local theatre productions. As such, they offer a direct line into the local theatre community for students wishing to explore theatre arts at a deeper commitment level.

Our members do not need prior experience in theatre. All members will receive training in the different aspects of stagecraft, opting to specialise in onstage performance, backstage management, or technical support. The Club welcomes anyone as everyone has something to contribute, even behind the scenes: designing and building props, sourcing materials and costumes, executing publicity campaigns and a myriad of other activities that combine to create the magic that is theatre.

Some of our club members have had the opportunity to be part of the Peer Pleasure Production Mentorship Programme since 2015, apprenticed to a professional production crew for the duration of the festival.  This is a valuable opportunity for our members to learn on the job and experience theatre works in the full scale.

Weekly training is scheduled every Wednesday from 3pm to 6pm.
