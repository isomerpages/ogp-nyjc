In 2026, the English Drama Club is looking forward to participating in the SYF Arts Presentation for Drama as well as our annual in-house Drama Night event. Indeed, a full theatre experience awaits members of the English Drama Club. Since the early ‘00s, our annual Drama Night production has changed from short play festivals, to double-bills, and even full length self-written musicals.

Our instructors have always been selected not only based on their experience in developing youth theatre, but also on their professional experience performing in local theatre productions. As such, they offer a direct line into the local theatre community for students wishing to explore theatre arts at a deeper commitment level.

Our members do not need prior experience in theatre. All members will receive training in the different aspects of stagecraft, opting to specialise in onstage performance, backstage management, or technical support. The Club welcomes anyone as everyone has something to contribute, even behind the scenes: designing and building props, sourcing materials and costumes, executing publicity campaigns and a myriad of other activities that combine to create the magic that is theatre.

Weekly training is scheduled every Wednesday from 3pm to 6pm, but will increase as we approach our SYF AP for Drama 2026 presentation date as well as our annual Drama Night event in May 2026.
