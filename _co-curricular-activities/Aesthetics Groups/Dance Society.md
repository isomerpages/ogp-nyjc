The NYJC Dance Society aims to provide a supportive environment for our dancers to discover and gain familiarity with various dance techniques and genres. It also aims to cultivate in our dancers an awareness and appreciation of aesthetics through creative expression of fluid body movement to music.

The society, comprising the Contemporary Wing and Street Wing, has grown rapidly over the years. The Contemporary Wing has performed consistently well for SYF Arts Presentation and at The Royal Dance-Off (TRDO) Competitions. The Contemporary Wing works on different genres, including Jazz, Broadway and Contemporary dance.  These varied genres allowed our dancers to explore the grounded movements of Jazz, while exploring the exaggerations of Broadway and the abstractness and breathing of Contemporary dance. The Street Wing has been taking part in competition RPresenting Hip Hop Dance competition. Our Street Dancers are exposed to Hip Hop, Street Jazz and Waacking.

NYJC dancers acquire and sharpen their performance skills and technical competency through various platforms: in-house performances such as Teachersâ€™ Day celebrations, CCA Bazaar and NYJC Open House; external competitions such as the SYF Arts Presentation, TRDO and other enrichment activities, including dance exchange with the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA) in Perth and dance immersion programme in Taipei.
