The NYJC Dance Society provides a supportive and inspiring environment where dancers can hone their craft and explore various techniques and genres. Our mission is
to foster a deep appreciation for aesthetics through creative expression and fluid movement, cultivating well-rounded dancers with a passion for the art form.

Our society comprises two distinct wings: the contemporary Wing and the Street Wing, yet together we build and grow. The Contemporary Wing has consistently excelled in the SYF Arts Presentation, delving into diverse styles such as Jazz, Broadway, Lyrical, and Contemporary dance. This exposure enables our dancers to experience a broad spectrum of movement, from the grounded energy of jazz to the dramatic flair of Broadway and the abstract nature of contemporary dance.

In contrast, the Street Wing focuses on high-energy styles like Hip-Hop, Street Jazz, Waacking, and Afrodance, providing an electrifying experience for our dancers. Through various platforms, our dancers refine their performance skills and technical competence,
participating in-house performances, external competitions, and enriching activities such as overseas dance exchanges and workshops with renowned institutions.

These opportunities include performances at Teachers' Day celebrations, CCA Bazaar, and NYJC Open House, as well as the SYF Arts Presentation. We have also had the
privilege of training and learning under esteemed institutions like the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA) in Perth, and in Seoul, South Korea, with GNI Dance Company and 1Million Dance Studio. Additionally, our dancers have trained under the guidance of instructors from Shanghai Institute of Visual Art, where they learnt the Cha Cha Cha, Jazz, and Locking, and had the opportunity to visit and learn from the Zhejiang Street Dance Association, further broadening their dance experience.

Step into our world of dance, where every step, every move, and every beat will transport you to new heights. Check out our dance concept videos filmed on campus
