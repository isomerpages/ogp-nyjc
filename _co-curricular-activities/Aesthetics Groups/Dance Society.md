The NYJC Dance Society offers a nurturing environment where dancers can explore and refine various techniques and genres. Our objective is to cultivate an appreciation for aesthetics through creative expression and fluid movement.

Our society comprises two wings: the Contemporary Wing and the Street Wing. The Contemporary Wing has consistently achieved success in the SYF Arts Presentation, exploring genres such as Jazz, Broadway, Lyrical and Contemporary dance. This enables our dancers to experience diverse styles, ranging from jazz's grounded movements to Broadway's exaggerations and contemporary dance's abstract nature. In contrast, the Street Wing focuses on Hip-Hop, Street Jazz, Waacking and Afrodance, which is utterly electrifying!

Through various platforms, our dancers hone their performance skills and technical competence. These opportunities include in-house performances, such as Teachers' Day celebrations, CCA Bazaar and NYJC Open House, as well as external competitions like the SYF Arts Presentation and TRDO. Additionally, we participate in enriching activities, including overseas dance exchanges and visits to renowned institutions like the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA) in Perth, Taipei and Seoul, where we train under the guidance of GNI Dance Company and 1Million Dance Studio. Quite simply, our dancers extend their reach far beyond the campus!

Beyond competitions, our dancers are involved in various dance concept videos, filmed on our picturesque campus. Be mesmerised by the energetic dance moves of our Street Wing and the elegant moves of our Contemporary Wing, set against the backdrop of our transformed learning space.
