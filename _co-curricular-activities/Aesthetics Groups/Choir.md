The Nanyang Junior College (NYJC) Choir is a mixed youth choir under the direction of Mr Terrence Toh. The NYJC Choir has been making its mark in both the local and overseas choral music scenes. After clinching gold awards in the Festival of Songs held in Olomouc, Czech Republic as well as the International Choir Competition Riva del Garda in Italy, the choir has continued to reach multiple milestones in its choral journey. In 2013 and 2018, the Choir was also a part of the Esplanade’s Limelight Series. In the 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, the Choir was awarded the Certificate of Distinction. The NYJC Choir had also performed with the Singapore Lyric Opera in the annual Gala Concerts in 2015 and 2016. The Choir also had multiple collaboration with choirs from Chung Cheng High School (Main), Chung Cheng High School (Yishun), Hwa Chong Institution, CHIJ Katong Convent and Anglo Chinese School (Independent).

The NYJC choir strives to continue making greater breakthroughs in our pursuit for choral excellence.

Our practices are held on Mondays, 5:30pm – 7:30pm and Wednesdays, 3:30pm – 7:30pm.
