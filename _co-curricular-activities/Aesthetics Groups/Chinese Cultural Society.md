NYJC Chinese Cultural Society (CCS) provides a platform for students to share their passion for Chinese theatre performing arts. Under the guidance of a professional instructor who is well known in Singapore’s theatre industry, members of CCS learn about theatre practices, and also get the chance to be exposed to both local and drama productions.

The weekly drama lessons are put to practical test when the CCS members work on their annual Chinese drama production, 《我们的白云岗》.《我们的白云岗》not only provides a chance for potential actors and actresses to showcase their talent on stage, but also many learning points about stage design, professional sound and lighting control, props and costume designing.

So, if you share the same passion towards theatre arts, be part of the CCS family!
