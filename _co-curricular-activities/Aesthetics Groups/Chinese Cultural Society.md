<p><strong>NYJC Chinese Cultural Society (CCS)</strong>&nbsp;provides a platform
for students to explore and share their passion for Chinese theatre arts.
Under the guidance of an accomplished professional instructor in Singapore
theatre, students receive expert mentoring, personalised feedback, and
exposure to industry practices, allowing them to develop their skills with
confidence and depth.</p>
<p>Our annual Chinese drama production,&nbsp;<strong>《我们的白云岗》</strong>, offers
students the opportunity not only to perform on stage, but also to take
on diverse roles throughout the production process. Covering scriptwriting,
directing, acting, stage design, sound and lighting, props, and costumes,
students gain hands-on experience and a well-rounded understanding of theatre
production.</p>
<p>Beyond skill development, CCS fosters a supportive and collaborative environment
where passions are nurtured and friendships are forged. Students who join
as new members and participate in the annual drama production will, in
the following year, step into leadership roles — planning and guiding the
entire production while mentoring the next cohort of new members. This
unique cycle cultivates leadership, communication, teamwork, and the ability
to inspire others throughout the creative process.</p>
<p>CCS offers students unique opportunities to explore Chinese theatre, develop
practical skills, and engage in creative production experiences.</p>
