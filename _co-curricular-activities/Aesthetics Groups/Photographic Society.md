They smile. We shoot.

As members of Nanyang Photographic Society (NYPS), we are greeted by smiles and beautiful sights countless times a day.

NYPS gives every student who is passionate about photography a platform to pick up new photographic skills and sharpen his/her sensitivity to the beauty in the surrounding. The college engages a professional photographer to conduct photography courses every year.

The photographers play an important role in capturing poignant moments during the different college events, contributing to a collection of valuable memories of college life.  The creative works of the members are also showcased at the annual photographic exhibition ‘Juxtapose’. Members have access to darkroom equipment consisting of DSLR cameras, lenses and professional editing platform, to facilitate the exploration of photographic imaginations.  There are also regular outings for members to hone their photography skills under various settings – nature, urban, model and studio.

The photographers meet every Wednesday from 3pm to 5pm.
