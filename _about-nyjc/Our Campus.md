<p>At NYJC, we are committed to creating a campus environment that balances
academic excellence, personal growth, and holistic development. Over the
years, the college has continuously enhanced its facilities, guided by
feedback from students and the evolving needs of education. Here's an overview
of our campus journey and our latest updates:</p>
<p><strong>Learning Spaces</strong>
</p>
<p>The enhancement of learning spaces has always been a priority at NYJC.
Since 2013, we have introduced various self-study units across the campus
to support group discussions, consultation sessions, and individual study.
These spaces provide a conducive and flexible environment for students
to collaborate, reflect, and learn at their own pace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2023, we embarked on a multi-phase journey to further elevate our campus,
beginning with a significant transformation of the library. This redesign,
shaped by student feedback, aims to create a vibrant hub of inquiry, collaboration,
and innovation.</p>
<p>The revamped library is now divided into two main sections:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Study Hub</strong>: Designed for focused study and group discussions,
this space will include individual discussion pods for meetings, a cozy
corner for rest, and dedicated areas for self-study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resource Hub</strong>: Beyond books and digital resources, this
section will offer access to equipment for recording, photo and video editing,
content creation software, and even counselling services to support student
well-being.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This vision for revitalised learning spaces will extend to other key areas,
including the Eblouissant and the Concourse, ensuring the entire campus
reflects a modern and student-centric design ethos.</p>
<p><strong>More Than Just a Dining Space</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2023, the college canteen underwent a major revamp based on student
input. The redesign improved seating capacity and enhanced the overall
ambience, making it a more inviting and functional space. Recognising the
importance of versatility, the new canteen also serves as a venue for study
sessions, group discussions, and even performances or community events,
fostering a dynamic campus culture.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;A Space for Play and More</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>NYJC is dedicated to fostering an active and vibrant
campus life.&nbsp; In 2021, the sheltered basketball courts were completed,
offering students a versatile space for sports and community events.&nbsp;
This area is not only used for basketball but has also become a central
venue for activities during Orientation and the CarNYval.</p>
<p>The collegeâ€™s other sports facilities include upgraded tennis courts,
fitness stations, a floorball-cum-street soccer court, and a well-equipped
gym enhanced with new equipment.&nbsp; These amenities support a wide range
of recreational and fitness activities, ensuring students have plenty of
opportunities to stay active and engaged.</p>
<p><strong>Balancing Work and Play</strong>
</p>
<p>At NYJC, we recognise that play is an integral part of learning. Beyond
the OAL facilities and sports spaces, students can enjoy lighter moments
with amenities like the X-box Kinect corner, foosball tables, arcade basketball
machines, air hockey in the student lounging area, and even campus swings.&nbsp;
Students can also book the BBQ pit for class gatherings, fostering bonds
in a relaxed setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring Safety and Security</strong>
</p>
<p>Safety has always been paramount at NYJC. Over the years, we have introduced
a range of measures, including:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Installation of 56 digital security cameras and the relocation of guard
posts and vehicle barriers in 2013.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of a facial recognition and temperature-taking system in
2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring efficient attendance tracking
and adherence to health protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
</p>
<p>As we move forward, NYJC remains committed to ensuring our campus evolves
to meet the aspirations of our students. By actively involving them in
shaping their learning environment, we continue to create a space that
inspires excellence, fosters innovation, and builds a vibrant and supportive
community.</p>
