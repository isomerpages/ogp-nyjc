<p><strong>A Strong Foundation for Greater Success</strong>
</p>
<p>Nanyang Junior College (NYJC) was founded in 1978 at its location in Serangoon
Ave 3 and was among the first junior colleges to be established in Singapore.
As NYJC’s campus was built on a small hill, fog often covered part of the
college in the 1980s and 1990s. NYJC was thus known affectionately as “白云岗”
(literally meaning “White Cloud Hill”, for the fog that covered it).</p>
<p>‘Nanyang’ is hanyu pinyin for the Chinese characters “南洋”（translated as
“Southern Seas”). This was used by the mainland Chinese to refer to the
region encompassed by Singapore, Malaysia and the Southeast Asian region.
The name is a reflection of the origins of Singapore having been built
by immigrants predominantly from China, India, Malaysia and other parts
of the world.</p>
<p>The college crest is a red shield with a blue base, the red and blue being
separated by a row of four crescents in yellow. Superimposed on this is
a white lion’s head. The red of the shield symbolises unity in strength;
the blue represents the southern seas; and the lion’s head stands for Singapore,
dubbed as the Lion City. The four crescents signify the multi-racial nature
as well as the growth of the college in tandem with the nation. The focus
on attaining growth and success based on collaboration, collective hard
work and the spirit of community is encapsulated in the college’s motto
of “Together We Build” （共同建设）.</p>
<p><strong>Our College Song</strong>
</p>
<p>The original college song was composed by M.Cheng, Leow Wee Seong (lyrics)
and L.Fang (Melody). The English version is sung during assemblies and
college functions.</p>
<p>In 2006, the school management committee decided that the college song
was in need of a rearrangement to keep it fresh and interesting. In January
2007, the college’s Symphonic Band retuned the school song that is played
every Wednesday.</p>

<p><strong>Our College Pledge</strong>
</p>
<p>The college pledge was introduced in 2007 as part of the 30th anniverary
celebrations. The Nanyang Pledge (2007) We, the students of Nanyang Junior
College, Pledge to be men and women of integrity; Showing empathy and concern,
We will be compassionate towards others; Meeting challenge with resilience,
We will be proactive and resourceful; Working together, We will build a
better future for our college and our community.</p>
<p><strong>Our Uniform</strong>
</p>
<p>Many would remember the reddish brown and black shoes worn by the early
batches of NYJCians. The former uniform was completely phased out in 2008,
giving way to the current beige ensemble.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Uniform.jpeg">
</div>
<p>In 2011, the college launched the official NYJC polo shirt. The shirt
came in two colours – white and navy, and it very quickly became the more
popular uniform option with many students owning these polo t-shirts. In
2013, the college added two more colours – light blue and red.</p>
<p><strong>Our History</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The 70's</strong>
</p>
<p>The junior college (JC) system was implemented at the end of the 1960s
to offer a challenging environment for students to develop their talents,
both in the academic and non-academic spheres. In the 1970s, Nanyang Junior
College, the seventh JC to be built, was established to meet the growing
demand for a JC education. In 1972, the Building Committee, chaired by
Mr Goh Tjoei Kok (JP, BBM), was formed and construction of the college
began in early October 1976.</p>
<p>In consultation with the Ministry of Education, the Lorong Chuan Junior
College Building Committee appointed Mr Chia Khoon Hock, the then Specialist
Advisor/Science as Principal Designate on 1st August 1977. Initially, the
college was named Lorong Chuan Junior College because of its location.
On 19th November 1977, after the fifth meeting of the Building Committee,
it was officially changed to Nanyang Junior College, with the approval
of the Ministry of Education. Nanyang JC is a government-aided JC.</p>
<p>The first cohort of Arts and Science students, about 600 altogether, was
enrolled in January 1978. They were housed temporarily in the then Westlake
Secondary School. With the completion of the construction of the major
buildings and facilities in November 1978, the staff and students moved
to the new premises in December 1978.</p>
<p>Moving into the new premises at Lorong Chuan involved the mammoth task
of organising the college and getting it into the most efficient working
condition. There were obstacles faced, but the sense of fulfillment in
overcoming these challenges was rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>The 80's</strong>
</p>
<p>On 26th January 1980, the Building Committee, which had been acting in
an advisory capacity, was dissolved and in its place a new Management Committee
was formed. Mr Goh Tjoei Kok, who was formerly the Chairman of the Building
Committee, was elected the Chairman of the School Management Committee
(SMC).</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/goh.jpeg">
</div>
<p>To mark the birth of the college, an Official Opening Week was planned
from 19th to 23rd May 1980. The Official Opening Ceremony was graced by
Mr Lee Khoon Choy, then Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister’s Office
and MP for Braddell Heights. The ceremony began with the Investiture of
the first School Management Committee. Mr Goh Tjoei Kok, the Chairman of
the Management Committee, then proceeded to lay the Foundation Stone of
the college. The celebrations, which went on for a week, included public
performances by the English, Malay, Chinese and Indian drama groups at
Victoria Theatre. An art exhibition was also held in our very own Art Studio.</p>
<p>Nanyang JC was appointed by the Ministry of Education to organise the
1981 Pre-University Seminar. In 1982, the college hosted the North Zone
Schools Colours Award Ceremony and the National Schools Sports Council
Colours Award Ceremony.</p>
<p>In the first five years since its establishment, the college focused on
building its identity and publicising the institution to the public. Subsequently,
the college consolidated the foundation built and raised the quality of
education to match the best of the junior colleges in Singapore.</p>
<p>As part of the efforts to foster creativity and aesthetic appreciation,
public performances in the four languages were staged by NYJCians. A musical
event – ‘Songs of Nanyang’ – featuring original compositions of our students,
was held at the DBS Auditorium in 1986. The college also staged an opera
performance, entitled ‘Dido &amp; Aeneas’ at the Victoria Theatre, and
a play by the Indian Cultural Society at the Drama Centre. The Malay Language
Cultural Society also organised an island-wide choral competition – Gema
Dikir Barat. The wide array of cultural activities in the 1980s reflected
the vibrant cultural atmosphere in the college as well as its emphasis
on multi-racialism.</p>
<p>The second half of the 1980s witnessed important milestones in our history.
In 1986, the college organised its first Open House to give secondary school
students an insight into life in Nanyang JC. While we welcomed potential
students to the college, we did not forget the students who helped to build
the Nanyang community. The NanyangN Junior College Alumni Association was
formed in 1988 to enable our students to maintain their ties with the college
and to foster a sense of belonging to their alma mater. Towards the end
of the decade, the college celebrated its 10th anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>The 90’s</strong>
</p>
<p>The 1990s began with the official opening of the Games Complex. The Complex
comprised an Air Rifle Range, a physical conditioning centre, two squash
courts and a multi-purpose hall for gymnastics and dancing.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/wee.jpeg">
</div>
<p>As part of its constant effort to improve the learning environment and
provide state-of-the-art technology, the college also built the Resource
Centre. The Foundation Stone of the Resource Centre was laid by the first
Chairman of the School Management Committee, Mr Goh Tjoei Kok. The three-storey
block housed the Resource Library, the Computer Centre, the AVA Room and
seminar rooms. The Resource Centre represented a significant investment
in the development of an intellectual environment. It was completed in
1993 and officially opened on 21st May 1995 by Mr Wee Cho Yaw, the second
Chairman of the School Management Committee.</p>
<p>The mid-1990s marked the 15th Anniversary of the college. To commemorate
this significant milestone in our history, the Publications Committee students
initiated the idea of a time capsule. They invited their peers to pen their
feelings about the college and were rewarded with an overwhelming response
from the student population. These notes, written by the principal, teachers
and students, together with several mementoes, were sealed in the time
capsule, scheduled to be revealed at the college’s 30th Anniversary celebration.</p>
<p>While we celebrated many significant developments in the 1990s, we were
also sad to see the departure of one of our pioneering leaders. Mr Goh
Tjoei Kok, the Chairman of the School Management Committee, passed away
in 1994. Mr Goh contributed much to the development of the college and
we were sad to see the demise of a generous philanthropist. Mr Wee Cho
Yaw succeeded as Chairman of the SMC.</p>
<p>In December 1994, the college bade farewell to our first Principal, Mr
Chia Khoon Hock. After 18 years of leading the college since its inception
in 1978, Mr Chia passed the baton to Mdm So Bie Leng in 1995.</p>
<p>The 1990s saw the launch of two important academic programmes in our college.
In 1997, Nanyang JC was selected to be the second college in Singapore
to be a centre for the Art Elective Programme (AEP). The college’s efforts
to foster a sense of pride in our cultural traditions were also recognized
when the Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) was launched by Rear
Admiral Teo Chee Hean, Minister for Education and Second Minister for Defence
in 1999. Nanyang JC was proud to be one of three centres then to offer
the Chinese Language Elective Programme.</p>
<p>To meet the changing demands of the times and to prepare our students
to meet the challenges of the new millennium, the college crafted its first
set of College Vision and Mission statements, with emphasis placed on the
four key values – commitment, conviction, confidence and compassion.</p>
<p>The College Mission and Vision statements were put into concrete terms
in the form of the Students’ Creed. The creed, a fusion of the contributions
of all civics tutorial groups, encapsulated the values NYJCians held dear
to their hearts. It was launched on 31 Dec 1999, by Professor Leo Tan,
Dean of the National Institute of Education.</p>
<p><strong>The 21st Century</strong>
</p>
<p>The college began the 21st century with a new principal - Mrs Ho Woon
Ho, as Mdm So Bie Leng retired from the service in December 1999. Under
Mrs Ho’s guidance, the college fine-tuned the Mission and Vision statements,
to emphasise our goal – to be a value-added college.</p>
<p>As part of our effort to add value to the whole person, Nanyang JC focused
on the inculcation of values and the nurturing of student leaders. In line
with this thrust of the college, the Student Leadership Development Department
was set up. The college organised Leadership Training Camps not only for
our CCA leaders, but also for the Class Committee members and the JC1 cohort.
All these reflect our belief that every student is a leader. These leadership
training courses and the Mental Skills training programme, are just a sample
of the wide variety of enrichment programmes the college has introduced
to develop the leadership potential and character of our students.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME Project: the rebuilding of the college</strong>
</p>
<p>At the turn of the century, many of the college facilities and parts of
the building started to show signs of wear and tear. The college was therefore
given the opportunity to rebuild its facilities under the Ministry of Education
PRIME project. As part of this programme, the Ministry Of Education bore
95% of the cost of reconstruction of the college. To minimise disruptions,
it was decided that the rebuilding of the college be on-site. The staff
and students took up the challenge of carrying on with the day-to-day operations
of the college with the on-going construction work. Despite the interruptions
to lessons and many college activities, they remained undaunted and were
eventually rewarded in 2004 when they were able to move to the spanking
new building, with its modern architecture and facilities. In the same
year, the college held a four-in-one programme, which consisted of the
25th College Day Prize-giving Ceremony, the Official Opening of the College
Alumni Clubhouse, the unveiling of the art mural – Eblouissant, and the
Homecoming Carnival.</p>
<p>In June 2005, the SMC explored the possibility of renaming Nanyang JC
as Chung Cheng Junior College. Owing to strong objection by the Alumni
of the college, the name of the college was retained.</p>
<p>In December 2005, the college bade farewell to our 3rd principal, Mrs
Ho Woon Ho who retired after more than 30 years in the education service.
Mrs Ho was succeeded by Mr Kwek Hiok Chuang.</p>
<p><strong>Revised JC Curriculum and the focus on Excellence</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2006, the revised JC curriculum was implemented by MOE. H3, H2 and
H1 subjects were introduced to replace the previous S-papers and subjects
read as ‘A’ or ‘AO’ levels respectively. Students were expected to read
3H2 and 1 H1 content-based subjects, together with H1 Project Work, H1
GP and H1 MTL. One of the H1 or H2 content-based subjects must be a contrasting
subject.</p>
<p>In view of the changed expectations and keen competition among the 17
JCs, Mr Kwek stressed the importance of enhancing the college’s image and
branding efforts. He led the college to focus on its performance in both
the academic and non-academic areas and the staff understood the importance
of delivering quality programmes and building an environment conducive
to the holistic development of NYJCians.</p>
<p>With the support of the staff and the commitment of NYJCians, the college
has been recognised for its consistent achievements in its ‘A’ Level examination
results, niche sports, Art &amp; crafts and aesthetics programmes.</p>
<p>NYJCians have done well in their ‘A’ Level examinations and furthered
their studies in reputable universities. While the national percentage
of JC students entering local universities stays at about 70%, NYJC has
had more than 80% of its students enter the local universities since 2013.
The college also witnessed an increase in the number of prestigious scholarships
obtained by the students.</p>
<p>The college has received the following academic value-added awards from
the Ministry of Education since 2007:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>2007 – Silver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2008 – Silver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2009 – Gold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2010 – Silver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2011 – Gold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2012 – Gold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2013 – Silver</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The college has been receiving the Ministry of Education’s Sustained Achievement
Award (SAA) for its Academic Value-added performance for 5 consecutive
years (from 2009 to 2013), and SAA for Aesthetics for 6 consecutive years
(from 2008 to 2013).</p>
<p>Based on the assessment outcomes by the external validators from the Ministry
of Education and SPRING Singapore in April 2009, the college was awarded
the School Distinction Award (SDA) and Singapore Quality Class (SQC). The
college also received the Best Practice Award (Staff Well-being) from then
Minister for Education, Dr Ng Eng Hen, at the Ministry of Education Workplan
Seminar in September 2009.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Ministry of Education revamped the school awards in order
to place more emphasis on recognising best practices by schools in delivering
a student-centric and values-driven education. As a result, the Masterplan
of Awards (MoA) was removed and 2013 was the last year that awards focusing
on academic excellence and CCA achievements such as the Sustained Achievement
Award, the School Excellent Award, and the Gold, Silver and Bronze Academic
Value-added Awards were given. (https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/moe-removes-secondary-school-banding-and-revamps-school-awards)</p>
<p>In line with the focus on delivering a well-rounded education, the Ministry
of Education gave recognition to schools with best practices in five key
aspects:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Best Practice in Teaching and Learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best Practice in Student All-Round Development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best Practice in Staff Development and Well Being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best Practice in Character and Citizenship Education (introduced in 2014)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best Practice in Partnership (introduced in 2014)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the assessment outcomes by the external validators from the Ministry
of Education and SPRING Singapore in April 2016, the college the college
received all of the Best Practice Awards from the Minister for Education
in 2017.</p>
<p>The college Volleyball (Boys’ &amp; Girls’) teams, Table Tennis (Boys’
&amp; Girls’) teams and Judo (Boys’ &amp; Girls’) teams have done the college
proud by consistently clinching the top 4 positions in the National ‘A’
Division Championships since 2004. Special mention must be made of our
Volleyball Boys and Girls teams which won the National School Games 'A'
Division Championship for two consecutive years (2017 and 2018), making
NYJC the first school in the history of Singapore to have such an achievement.
Other sport groups such as the college Badminton Teams, the Basketball
Teams and the Soccer Team have also noteworthy achievements in the recent
years.</p>
<p>The performing arts groups (i.e. Chinese Orchestra, Symphonic Band, Guzheng
Ensemble, Choir, Drama and Dance) have also done the college proud for
consistently obtaining prestigious awards from the SYF Central Judging.</p>
<p><strong>Service-learning and Community Involvement</strong>
</p>
<p>Nanyang JC adopts a whole-college approach in encouraging students to
initiate both local and overseas service-learning projects. They learn
to identify the needs of the community and reflect on their own experience
in working with the community. Some of the projects initiated by students
over the years include Little Bundles of Happiness with YWCA, service-learning
project at Chen Su Lan Methodist Children’s Home, Project CARElderly, Terrarium
Building @ IJVillage, Music Therapy @ KK Hospital, Clean-Up and Refurbishing
of low-income families in alliance with AWWA, Project Listen with Guide
Dog Association of the Blind, and Mooncake-making with the seniors at Calvary
Community Care.</p>
<p>Since 2007, our staff members have set a good example by performing service-learning
through establishing long-term partnerships with Ministry of Education
Adventure Centre to enhance the green spaces, Lion Befrienders@AMK to interact
with the elderly; Serangoon Moral Student Care Centre for homework supervision;
the National Parks Singapore to conduct Invasive Species Management at
Peirce Reservoir, Bishan – Ang Mo Kio Park, Dairy Farm Nature Park, and
Singapore Quarry; Food from the Heart to help pack food hampers; and TOUCH
Community Services’ to deliver meals to home-bound elderly in its Meals-on-wheels
programme. In 2017, the staff embarked on new projects with MDAS and IMH
to reach out to people with muscular dystrophy and people suffering mental
disorder.</p>
<p>The college participated in the Step Up Challenge in 2013 to raise funds
for needy families, and NYJCians have been part of the Walk For Rice project
since 2011. About 100 students work with the South East CDC and Braddell
Heights Division on community projects such as Rice Distribution @ BH project
for 150 needy residents, food distribution @ BH project, Community Leadership
Projects on neighbourliness and family bonding projects. The college enjoys
a close tie with Braddell Heights Community and South East CDC.</p>
<p>The college is also one of the key partners of the Chinese Development
Assistance Council (CDAC) and was awarded the CDAC’s Outstanding Partner
Award in 2013. Besides organising various community services and welfare
programmes to help the lower income families, the college has been co-hosting
the annual Ready For School Programme with CDAC since 2012.</p>
<p>The college also received the PA Community Spirit (Merit) Award for the
2nd consecutive year in 2014 in recognition of the college’s continual
and good efforts in fostering meaningful partnerships with the community
and other agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Review, Rethink, Reinvent (3Rs)</strong>
</p>
<p>The 3Rs are very important to the college's planning and development.
It is undergirded by our belief that there is no sacred cow too big to
slaughter and it is important that as an education institution, Nanyang
JC is constantly reviewing its processes and programmes in order to create
learning spaces and a learning environment that is responding to and anticipating
new needs and challenges.</p>
<p>Besides constantly reviewing and enhancing our instructional and co-curricular
programme, the college is also known for introducing dress-down days, late
starting time, 10-days timetable, flexible subject combinations – all done
to enhance NYJCians’ well-being.</p>
<p>This effort to challenge the norm and time-honoured ways to bring about
progress is not only limited to the college's internal processes and programmes.
One example is the successful mooting and changing of the Pre-U Seminar
format.</p>
<p><strong>Format of Pre-U Seminar changed after 40 years</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2013, the college organised the Pre-University Seminar at U-Town for
540 students from the various JCs, Integrated Programme schools, International
Baccalaureate schools, and polytechnics. The theme of the seminar was Singapore
2030: Our Future, Our Home. The format of the seminar was changed for the
first time since its inception. The refreshed seminar format brought student
ownership and thought leadership to the forefront, with the aim of creating
a seminar by students, for students.</p>
<p>**A popular and trusted college **</p>
<p>Over the years, Nanyang JC has become a reputable and popular JC in Singapore.
With the college’s increasing popularity and the consistent excellent performance
at the GCE ’A’ level examinations, the college, in 2014, saw more than
4000 GCE ‘O’ level graduates putting Nanyang JC as their top three preferred
JCs, all vying to be 1 of the 700 JC1s to be admitted into the college.</p>
<p>From 2005 to date, the cut-off points (based on L1R5) improved gradually
from 12 points for both the Science and Arts courses to 6 points for Science
and 7 for the Arts in 2016 and 2017, placing us ahead of all our comparable
colleges.</p>
<p>Besides the credible results attained by NYJCians in both academic and
non-academic areas, other factors have contributed to the continued popularity
of the college.</p>
<p><em>Enjoying easy accessibility</em>
</p>
<p>With the MRT Circle Line starting its operation in May 2009, Nanyang JC,
sited next to Lorong Chuan Circle Line Station, became even more accessible.
Moreover, the college is also served by 13 public bus services. As a result,
NYJC is recognised as one of the most accessible JCs in Singapore.</p>
<p><em>Keeping our college up-to-date</em>
</p>
<p>In February 2011, the college refurbished its running track and the soccer
field was replaced with a synthetic field. The brand new 8 lanes running
track and soccer field were officially opened on 12 May 2012 at the college’s
Sports Carnival.</p>
<p>In March 2012, the college upgraded the library and self-study areas.
The seating capacities for the library and self-study areas were increased
significantly.</p>
<p>In November 2012, the college further enhanced its facilities so as to
provide a more conducive environment for learning and life-skills development.
Four high element adventurous stations and three low element team-building
stations were constructed. A barbeque pit was also constructed.</p>
<p>In November 2013, the college built its floor ball cum street soccer Court,
created a landscape garden and upgraded the study corners, basketball and
tennis courts to enhance the NY Experience.</p>
<p>In 2014, the college installed a number of Big S fans in the canteen,
along the study areas near the Eblouissant and the hall to ensure good
circulation of air and cooler environment.</p>
<p>To meet the demands for more indoor areas to hold performances, exhibitions
and group activities, the college constructed a roof over the concourse
in 2015. Full-length mirrors were installed along the corridor of the concourse
so that the different dance groups can have an additional area to conduct
their dance practices.</p>
<p>2015 also saw the college getting a new colour scheme when the repainting
of college was arranged.</p>
<p>In 2016, the college installed an additional 70” TV in the canteen to
broadcast Channel News Asia so that students can be updated with the happenings
of the world as they are being reported.</p>
<p>Works to enhance the football field started at the end of 2017 with the
installation of vertical netting.</p>
<p>2020 saw the implementation of a facial recognition and temperature taking
system to ensure efficient attendance tracking.</p>
<p>In 2023, the college put the Outdoor Adventure Learning Courses through
ACCT inspection to ensure the safety standards of the facilities. 2023
also saw the completion of the revamped canteen, adopting a brighter tone
and flexible furniture to transform the canteen into a multipurpose space.&nbsp;
It is also the year which saw the beginning of a multi-phase enhancement
to the learning spaces in the college, starting with the library. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Playing an active role</em>
</p>
<p>When the Provisional Admission Exercise ceased in 2009, NYJC introduced
the very first JC Experience to provide secondary school graduates exploring
their post-secondary options an opportunity to learn more about JC curriculum
and JC life before they make their choices at the Joint Admission Exercise
(JAE). JC experience started as a 3-days programme and participants from
different secondary schools got to attend sample lectures and tutorials,
participate in games and dialogues, and most importantly gained a better
appreciation of what JC education is about. The programme has been updated
and enhanced and even though it was later changed to a 1-day programme,
the objective of supporting the students in making informed post-secondary
choices is still met. In January 2018, the college organised its 10th JC
Experience.</p>
<p>In December 2016, after spending 11 years in NYJC, our 4th principal,
Mr Kwek Hiok Chuang retired from education service and handed over the
baton to Mr Low Chun Meng.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Anniversary Celebrations</strong>
</p>
<p>NYJC has always marked its milestone anniversaries with a blend of nostalgia,
community engagement, and forward-looking initiatives, celebrating its
rich history while connecting past and present generations of NYJCians.</p>
<p>30<sup>th</sup> Anniversary (2007)</p>
<p>The college celebrated its 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary in April 2007 with
a vibrant carnival graced by Mr. Tharman Shanmugaratnam, then Minister
for Education.&nbsp; To commemorate this milestone, the JC1 cohort participated
in painting large wall murals across 30 HDB blocks in Braddell Heights
Constituency, a project highly commended by the Housing Development Board
for promoting community service.</p>
<p>35<sup>th</sup> Anniversary (2013)</p>
<p>Building on the success of the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary murals, the
college refreshed the existing artwork and extended the initiative to beautify
the void decks of an additional five HDB blocks in the same constituency.&nbsp;
This effort received commendations from residents, the Marine Parade Town
Council, and NTUC Fairprice.&nbsp; More than 250 alumni returned to campus
for the 35<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Dinner, organised by the Alumni Association
on 17 August 2013, celebrating the bonds that tie NYJCians across generations.</p>
<p>40<sup>th</sup> Anniversary (2018)</p>
<p>The 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary was a landmark celebration under the leadership
of the college’s fifth principal, Mr Low Chun Meng.&nbsp; The Nanyang Junior
College Alumni Association, in partnership with the School Management Committee,
hosted an Anniversary Dinner attended by past principals, staff and students,
with Mr. Tan Chuan Jin as Guest of Honour.</p>
<p>Student leaders played a significant role in organising the inaugural
RemiNYscence Carnival, which welcomed alumni, staff, and current students
to an afternoon of games, nostalgia, and camaraderie.&nbsp; Many students
attended with their parents, who were themselves NYJC alumni, creating
a special intergenerational connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To honour the college’s artistic heritage, the Heritage Gallery was revamped,
featuring new achievements and alumni stories.&nbsp; As an Art Elective
Centre, we are happy to have produced many outstanding young artists such
as Lee Xin Li, Lim Qixuan, Debbie Ding and Sarah Choo who have gone on
to establish themselves in the art scene.&nbsp; The college is happy to
commission 2 of our AEP graduates – Lee Xin Li and Chan Wing Tin to work
on two pieces of wall mural for the Heritage Gallery.&nbsp; Xin Li’s illustration
focused on the transition from the old NYJC building to the new, showing
how NYJC has grown and transformed in the 40 years. NY40 by Wing Tin is
a piece featuring 40 icons that are tied to the NY experience of different
batches of students.&nbsp; Other than these 2 murals, the AEP unit also
set up an Art Gallery on campus to showcase the artistic flair of our Art
Elective Programme alumni.</p>
<p>45<sup>th</sup> Anniversary (2023)</p>
<p>NYJC celebrated its 45<sup>th</sup> anniversary with the theme “RemiNYscence:
Let’s Nanyang”.&nbsp; This homecoming event brought together students from
various cohorts, staff, and principals for a day of reunion and reflection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NYJCians from earlier cohorts enjoyed matching their memories of the old
campus with current facilities, attending “lectures” conducted by familiar
faces, experiencing a sense of connection across generations.&nbsp; A highlight
of the event was the recreation of the iconic red-blue PE T-shirt worn
by student guides to symbolise the unity of the NYJC family regardless
of the batch.</p>
