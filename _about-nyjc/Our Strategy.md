<p>****<strong>Let's call a Spade a Spade</strong>
</p>
<p>We at NYJC believe that students come to us because they want to get to
a university of their choice. We take our core business of Teaching and
Learning (T &amp; L) very seriously. We commit to being a learning community
where engaged practitioners inspire passionate inquirers through effective,
relevant and value-centric teaching and learning.</p>
<p><strong>Passion drives and Happiness matters</strong>
</p>
<p>It is important to us that our students and staff enjoy what they do in
the college. Schools cannot be just about assignments and examinations.
We believe that holistic education is the key to well-developed individuals
who will be able to take on the challenges of the future and excel in a
dynamic environment. We allow our students to take ownership of their learning
and development, evident in the more than 150 subject combinations and
the myriad of co-curricular activities. We have also designed a unique
Managing Self Leading Others (MSLO) framework to enhance the capabilities
and capacities of our students in the areas of character and leadership
development.</p>
