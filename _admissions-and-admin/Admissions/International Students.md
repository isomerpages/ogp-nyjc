**For students from International Schools**

Nanyang JC has accepted students who have graduated from secondary schools in Malaysia, Indonesia, the People's Republic of China and India, among other countries. As the examination system differs from country to country, we will consider such applications on a case-by-case basis.

International students seeking admission to Nanyang JC may apply to take the qualifying tests administered by the Principals' Academy of Singapore. The academy will advise the applicants on the junior colleges they have qualified for based on the results of the tests and met the criteria set. More information may be obtained at http://pact.sg/
