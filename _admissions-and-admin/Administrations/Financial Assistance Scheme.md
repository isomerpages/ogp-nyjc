<p><strong>MOE Financial Assistance Scheme</strong>
<br>The Ministry of Education (MOE) offers financial support to Singaporean
students from low-income families studying in Government and Government-Aided
Schools. For more information on the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS),
please click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>MOE also invites students to apply for the Edusave Merit Bursary (EMB)
if they have done well in their studies and their household income meets
the criteria set by the MOE. Please click <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/awards-scholarships/edusave-awards" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for
more information on the MOE website.</p>
<p>Help is also available for students who are not eligible for the MOE FAS
or EMB. Students who need financial assistance can approach their Civics
Tutors, CCA teachers, or the General Office staff for advice.</p>
<p>Financial assistance, bursaries and awards are made available to help
lessen the financial burden for students-in-need. We hope that these will
enable students to focus on learning and, in future, contribute back to
the community who nurtured them.</p>
