<p><strong>Cycling - Advisory to Students</strong>
<br>Students cycling to school must ask their parents to sign the acknowledgement
of the Advisory Note on Cycling to School and submit it to the General
Office (GO). Form is available at the GO.</p>
<p>1. Any student cycling on the public roads must obey the same rules as
other vehicles. A cyclist may be punished under the Penal Code/Road Traffic
Act should he/she act rashly or negligently so as to endanger human life
or the personal safety of others.</p>
<p>2. The general cycling safety rules to be taught to students for recreational
cycling may include the following:</p>
<p>a. For recreational cycling by students, they should cycle on designated
bicycle tracts in parks or on park connectors only. There should be no
cycling on expressways, road tunnels and areas demarcated with prohibitive
signs.</p>
<p>b. Always make sure that the bicycle is in good working condition, e.g.
working brakes, tyres, lights (front and rear), bell, are working, chains
are secure, etc.</p>
<p>c. Always wear protective gear such as a properly secured helmet, shoes
(with laces properly tied), elbow and knee pads to protect against injuries.</p>
<p>d. Give undivided attention to ensure safety for oneself and other cyclists,
motorists and pedestrians. Do not use mobile phones and ear phones while
cycling.</p>
<p>e. Cyclists should not unreasonably obstruct or prevent free passage of
a vehicle or pedestrian. Always yield to pedestrians when cycling on footpaths.</p>
<p>f. No pillion passenger shall be carried on a bicycle unless it is designed
to do so. If necessary, there should be a properly-constructed child seat
affixed firmly to the bicycle.</p>
<p>g. Cycling abreast is prohibited.</p>
<p>h. Do not cycle across overhead pedestrian bridges or pedestrian crossings.
Dismount and push your bicycle and practice proper kerb drills before crossing
the road.</p>
<p>i. Always use the correct hand signals when turning left or right or stopping.
Make them in sufficient time to enable other motorists to take appropriate
action.</p>
