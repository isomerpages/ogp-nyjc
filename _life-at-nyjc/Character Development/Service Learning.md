<h1>Service-Learning @ Nanyang Junior College: Student-initiated CCE Projects</h1>
<p>At Nanyang Junior College, our students are strongly encouraged to initiate
class-based and CCA-based&nbsp;CCE&nbsp;projects with an emphasis on Service-Learning
(S-L) which will benefit the wider community. Students who are interested
to initiate and lead a&nbsp;CCE&nbsp;project can volunteer to be an S-L
Advocate, which is an official appointment under the collegeâ€™s leadership
portfolio for the Class Executive Committee. Appointed S-L Advocates will
undergo a training&nbsp;programme&nbsp;where they will be trained in S-L
methodology, project management and facilitation skills.</p>
<p>Through the&nbsp;five part&nbsp;journey of investigation, planning, actual
implementation, reflection and demonstration, the S-L&nbsp;programme&nbsp;in
NYJC works towards achieving both Service and Learning objectives while
engaging the community. Participants will&nbsp;analyse&nbsp;their needs
analysis of real issues facing the community and use what they have learnt
in the classroom to solve real-life problems. For example, if students
collect trash along the beach,&nbsp;analyse&nbsp;their findings to determine
the possible sources of pollution and share the results with residents
(public) or an authority (National Environment Agency), they are engaged
in the process of S-L where they can apply their knowledge from General
Paper (global issues), Project Work, Science, Mathematics, Economics and
other academic subjects to real-world issues.</p>
<p>By combining volunteerism and structured experiential learning, service
to the community transforms you as an individual and in turn, this change
enriches the service you render to the community.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives of Service-Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Before embarking on a&nbsp;CCE&nbsp;project, there are two types of objectives
that students need to determine:</p>
<p>Service Objectives
<br>To meet community needs through the involvement of students, staff and
community partners in meaningful service</p>
<p>Learning Objectives
<br>To cultivate our five college values: Drive, Responsibility Integrity,
Inventiveness and Empathy through&nbsp;programme&nbsp;design, service to
the community, facilitation and reflection</p>
