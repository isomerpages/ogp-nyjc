<p><strong>Code of Conduct</strong>
</p>
<p>The Nanyang Junior College Code of Conduct framework is essential in upholding
a safe, respectful, and nurturing environment where every student can learn
and grow to their fullest potential. This framework serves as a guide for
responsible decision-making and personal accountability, aligning with
our mission to uphold values, enhance life skills, and maximize potential.
By understanding the impact of their actions and choices, students learn
to exercise Integrity, Empathy, and Responsibility — key traits that form
the foundation of strong character and good citizenship.</p>
<p>Beyond maintaining order, the College’s Code of Conduct framework plays
a vital role in shaping students’ holistic development. It cultivates self-discipline,
social awareness, and respect for the community, ensuring that students
develop both emotional resilience and moral strength. When students internalize
these expectations, they learn to act with Drive, take Responsibility for
their behavior, and uphold Integrity in all circumstances. It is a cornerstone
that promotes mutual trust and respect within the College community. It
ensures that everyone enjoys a safe, inclusive, and conducive environment
for learning and growth. By observing these shared standards, students
embody the NYJC spirit — being empathetic in their relationships with others
— preparing them to become confident, gracious, and well-rounded leaders
who will contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
