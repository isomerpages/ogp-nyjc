At Nanyang JC, building character in our students is our core. The many threads of our college’s initiatives are woven and integrated into a unique and holistic character development programme under the Managing Self, Leading Others framework.
The importance of character development in our students is clearly articulated in our mission – Uphold Values, Enhance Lifeskills and Maximise Potential, and this is supported by school-wide Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Programmes including the Service Learning projects and Student-initiated Projects (SIPs).

The caring culture has without doubt resulted in a college where all members share the responsibility of making possible our vision of nurturing thinking, resilient and compassionate leaders. Students are enriched via their participation in Overseas Service-Learning Expeditions, life skills programmes, whole-cohort leadership camps, Service-Learning Courses and Mentoring Courses. All these have resulted in NYJC achieving the Developmental Award for Character Development in 2008 and 2011.
