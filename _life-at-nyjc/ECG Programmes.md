<p><strong>EDspiration</strong>
<br>
<br>As part of our holistic approach in educating NYJCians on future career
and education options, NYJC hosts EDspiration – an annual event that invites
speakers from various institutes of higher learning and industries to share
about their professions and university courses with the JC2 students. EDspiration
caters to two main needs of our students – exploring options for higher
education and examining career opportunities. Speakers from various industries
have been invited to provide insights into their respective professions.
Among the invited speakers were Ms. Gayathri Ramesh from the Association
of Podiatric Medicine (Singapore), alumni like Mr Kevin Chee, the founder
of Matchaya, and Mr Jonathan Lau from Micron. They spoke about their personal
experiences in their respective fields and addressed students’ queries
and concerns. In addition, representatives from the various local universities
(NUS, NTU, SMU, SIT, Yale-NUS and SUTD) are also regularly invited to EDspiration.
The speakers talk about the diverse selection of courses that students
can choose from and their respective prerequisites, as well as research
and overseas exchange programmes offered by the various universities. Information
on scholarships were also provided by representatives from SIA, MOHH, CSA,
GovTech and IMDA.

<br><strong>EDventure</strong>
<br>EDventure is an experiential learning platform for students. Through EDventure,
students are encouraged to take part in educational journeys to higher
learning institutes and participate in workshops conducted by these institutes.
Through these activities, students can experience university life and pick
up a new skill at the same time. Some of the programmes that our students
have participated in include the Chem E Challenge and FASS Track Youth
Academy conducted by NUS, Science Discovery Day, CEE Summer Camp and LKC
Med Camp and the science and engineering workshops (seeNTU) conducted by
NTU.</p>

<p><strong>EDubuzz</strong>
</p>
<p>The EDubuzz programme is a series of lunch time talks where representatives
from local and overseas institutions such as the Cambridge University Malaysia
and Singapore Association (CUMSA) and Russell Group universities are invited
to share about higher education programmes and prepare students on application
procedures to their desired tertiary institutions. We have also invited
our alumni to share about their professional work such as Ms Lee Yi Jia
and Ms Tan Jia Min who co-produced the Singaporean feature film – We Can
Save The World!!! &nbsp;Annually, workshops like personal statement writing
and interview preparation are conducted to equip students with skills that
allow them to transit smoothly into university.
<br>
<br><strong>EDspirience</strong>
<br>EDspirience is an NYJC Work Attachment Programme which allows students
to explore and discover their career aspirations through work experience.
Our long-term healthcare partners, Kidney Dialysis Foundation, Singapore
Heart Foundation, NTFGH Dietetics, SGH Physiotherapy Department, SGH Speech
Therapy, and IMH Nursing have offered diverse job shadowing and observation
opportunities for students to learn about the various allied healthcare
professions. National Museum has offered work opportunities to students
interested in the arts. Through the work attachment programme, our students
learn valuable work ethics and pick up important transferable skills from
their workplace supervisors and colleagues.
