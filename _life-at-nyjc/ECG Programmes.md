<p>In line with the MOE ECG framework, ECG programmes in NYJC are designed
based on the themes of career identity, career exploration and career planning.
Our guiding principles when designing ECG programmes are:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><code>Meeting student needs</code>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All ECG programmes are tailored according to the needs of our students.
During the planning stage, student surveys play an important part in guiding
the programme content. For example, when planning for our career seminar,
students will be surveyed on the type of career talks they are interested
in attending.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><code>Adopting a whole college approach</code>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The college involves many stakeholders in ECG. Besides civic tutors who
are trained to deliver ECG lessons and handle ECG conversations, student
representatives are also trained to champion ECG within their own class.</p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><code>Developing network and bonds</code>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Developing bonds and network ties with external organisations, parents
and alumni is key to a successful ECG programme. Not only does the school
value its long term partnerships with external organisations, it also actively
reaches out to parents and alumni to participate and spearhead ECG programmes.</p>

<p><strong>EDspiration</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our holistic approach in educating NYJCians on future career
and education options, NYJC hosts EDspiration – an annual event that invites
speakers from various institutes of higher learning and industries to share
about their professions and university courses with the JC2 students. EDspiration
caters to two main needs of our students – exploring options for higher
education and examining career opportunities. Speakers from various industries
have been invited to provide insights into their respective professions.
Among the invited speakers were Ms Lynn Lee (Awfully Chocolate), Mr Daniel
Ong (Twelve Cupcakes), Mr Josephus Tan (Fortis Law) and Ms Sylvia Chan
(Night Owl Cinematics). They spoke about their personal experiences in
their respective fields and addressed students’ queries and concerns. In
addition, representatives from the various local universities (NUS, NTU,
SMU, SIT, Yale-NUS and SUTD) are also regularly invited to EDspiration.
The speakers talk about the diverse selection of courses that students
can choose from and their respective prerequisites, as well as research
and overseas exchange programmes offered by the various universities. Information
on scholarships is also provided by representatives from organisations
like Ministry of Health Holdings and Ministry of Education.</p>
<p><strong>EDubuzz</strong>
</p>
<p>The EDubuzz programme is a series of lunch time talks where representatives
from local and overseas institutions like British Council and EducationUSA
are invited to share about higher education programmes and prepare students
on application procedures to their desired tertiary institutions. Annually,
workshops like personal statement writing and interview preparation are
conducted to equip students with skills that allow them to transit smoothly
into university.</p>
<p><strong>EDspirience</strong>
</p>
<p>EDspirience is an NYJC Work Attachment Programme which allows students
to explore and discover their career aspirations through work experience.
Many established organisations such as the Singapore Academy of Law and
Tan Tock Seng Hospital have partnered the college in this endeavour. Through
the work attachment programme, our students learn valuable work ethics
and pick up important transferable skills from their workplace supervisors
and colleagues.</p>
<p><strong>EDventure</strong>
</p>
<p>EDventure is an experiential learning platform for students. Through EDventure,
students are encouraged to take part in educational journeys to higher
learning institutes and participate in workshops conducted by these institutes.
Through these activities, students can experience university life and pick
up a new skill at the same time. Some of the programmes that our students
have participated in include programming workshops conducted by NUS, accountancy
camps in SMU, science and engineering workshops in NTU and Design workshops
in SUTD.</p>
<p><strong>ECG Portal</strong>
</p>
<p>This one-stop portal (<a href="https://ecg.nanyangjc.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://ecg.nanyangjc.moe.edu.sg/</a>)
is designed for NYJC students exclusively. In this portal, students can
further explore their career options, local and overseas higher education
options, find work attachment opportunities and link up with alumni who
have done well.</p>
<h1>Other initiatives</h1>
<p><strong>ECG counselling</strong>
</p>
<p>The college has an in-house ECG counsellor, Mr Shaun Han, who gives individualised
attention to students and guides them in affirming their career aspirations.
He also conducts workshops for teachers and equips them with basic skills
on ECG counselling and provides up-to-date information on job and higher
education trends.</p>
<p><strong>Teacher training</strong>
</p>
<p>Teachers are trained to conduct ECG lessons as well as carry out ECG conversations
with students. They are kept informed about current higher education and
job trends. During professional development sessions, teachers are also
provided with resources in writing references and guided on how best to
use them.</p>
<p><strong>Alumni and Parent involvement</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents are invited to a yearly dialogue session with the universities
to clarify doubts about university applications. The college also welcomes
parents’ participation in EDspiration either as career speakers or audience.
In addition, the college works closely with a growing network of alumni
members who return to NYJC to conduct workshops or talks to inspire their
juniors to explore various career opportunities.</p>
