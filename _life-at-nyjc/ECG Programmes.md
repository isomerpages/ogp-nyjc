<p>In line with the MOE ECG framework, ECG programmes in NYJC are designed
based on the themes of career identity, career exploration and career planning.
Our guiding principles when designing ECG programmes are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Renting student needs</strong>
</p>
<p>All ECG programmes are tailored according to the needs of our students.
During the planning stage, student surveys play an important part in guiding
the programme content. For example, when planning for our career seminar,
students will be surveyed on the type of career talks they are interested
in attending.</p>
<p><strong>2. Adopting a whole college approach</strong>
</p>
<p>The college involves many stakeholders in ECG. Besides civic tutors who
are trained to deliver ECG lessons and handle ECG conversations, student
representatives are also trained to champion ECG within their own class.</p>
<p><strong>3. Developing network and bonds</strong>
</p>
<p>Developing bonds and network ties with external organisations, parents
and alumni is key to a successful ECG programme. Not only does the school
value its long term partnerships with external organisations, it also actively
reaches out to parents and alumni to participate and spearhead ECG programmes.</p>
<p><strong>NYJC ECG Programmes: </strong>
<br><strong>EDspiration</strong>
</p>
<p>This annual event invites speakers from various industries and institutes
of higher learning to share insights into their professions and university
courses with the JC2 students. In 2025, we reverted to a physical event
for students to better engage with the speakers. Career speakers include
Ms Gayathri Ramesh from the Association of Podiatric Medicine (Singapore),
alumni like Mr Kevin Chee, the founder of Matchaya, and Mr Jonathan Lau
from Micron. They spoke about their personal experiences and answered queries
posed by students. In addition, representatives from various local universities
also presented on a diverse selection of courses that students can choose
from and their respective pre-requisites. Information on scholarships was
also provided by representatives from SIA, MOHH, CSA, GovTech and IMDA.</p>
<p><strong>EDventure</strong>
</p>
<p>This&nbsp; programme allows students to venture out of college to explore
various fields of interest. Students have participated in various programmes
conducted by NTU such as seeNTU, Science Discovery Day, CEE Summer Camp
and LKC Med Camp and by NUS such as Chem E Challenge and FASS Track Youth
Academy. Students have also attended the Family Justice Courts Open House
and had a fireside chat with the District Judges to find out more about
Singapore’s&nbsp; judicial system.</p>
<p><strong>EDubuzz</strong>
</p>
<p>This programme is a series of lunch time talks where representatives from
local and overseas universities and local organisations are invited to
share about their institutions and conduct interview workshops, preparing
students to apply to their desired tertiary institutions. In 2025, the
institutions involved included Cambridge University Malaysia and Singapore
Association (CUMSA) and Russell Group universities. We also invited our
alumni Ms Lee Yi Jia and Ms Tan Jia Min to share with students about the
Singaporean feature film that they produced – We Can Save The World!!!.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>EDspirience</strong>
</p>
<p>Through work attachment programmes, students can gain experience in the
working world and more insights about their career aspirations. Our long-term
healthcare partners, Kidney Dialysis Foundation, Singapore Heart Foundation,
NTFGH Dietetics, SGH Physiotherapy Department, SGH Speech Therapy, and
IMH Nursing have offered diverse job shadowing and observation opportunities
for students to learn about the various allied healthcare professions.
National Museum, Junior College Law Programme, PSA Singapore and TinkerTanker
have offered work opportunities to students as well.</p>
<p><strong>EDmissions</strong>
</p>
<p>This programme focuses on supporting students' applications to both local
and overseas universities. A key feature of EDmissions is the appointment
of Teacher Admissions Coordinators who are responsible for specific regions.
Apart from local universities, the Teacher Admissions Coordinators can
advise on the application requirements for study destinations such as the
United Kingdom, United States, China, Australia and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
