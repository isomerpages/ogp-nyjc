<p><strong>A Student-development Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Every July, NYJCians who demonstrate exceptional character, academic excellence,
and leadership potential are invited to join NYJC Galileo, one of the college’s
most prestigious student development programmes. This programme aims to
equip students with essential values and skills, fostering their growth
into active global citizens ready to contribute meaningfully to society
and achieve their fullest potential. To achieve this aim, NYJC Galileo
collaborates with different Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) and college
committees to organise and coordinate diverse workshops and activities
throughout the year, tailored to meet students’ developmental needs.</p>
<p>One standout feature is the Crafting my Story of Self workshop, where
Year Two Galileo students explore their values and strengths by sharing
personal stories that define their identity and priorities.&nbsp; Another
notable highlight is the Galileo Fire-side Chat, usually held in May as
a Zoom seminar. In 2023, NYJC Galileo alumni, Ms. Chew Jiahui (NUS Geography
/ URA Scholar) and Ms. Rachele Letchme Mohan (NUS Yong Loo Lin School of
Medicine / NUS Merit Scholarship), shared their university experiences,
emphasising personal growth and providing insights into the advantages
and challenges of scholarship opportunities.</p>
<p>Each year, two teams of Year Two Galileo students participate in the Nanyang
Junior College – Braddell Heights CCC Community Leadership Programme (CLP),
a six-month student-leadership initiative. This programme includes Block
Visits and Meet-the-People Sessions, culminating in a project designed
to enhance the lives of residents in the Braddell Heights community. In
2023, one team identified a decline in family bonding due to the pandemic
and organised a Family Fair. This event featured engaging games and activities
aimed at fostering meaningful connections between parents and children.</p>
<p>The Leadership Series, a flagship component of NYJC Galileo, invites accomplished
individuals – such as entrepreneurs, poets, and corporate leaders – to
share their journeys and achievements, inspiring students to pursue their
passions. In Term 2 of 2024, for instance, Mr Edward Lim shared his leadership
experiences across various organisations, including Wilmar International,
one of Asia's leading agri-business groups, and his role on the COVID-19
Ministerial Taskforce at the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Previous speakers
include Mr. Tong Yee, co-founder of The Thought Collective, and Mr Jason
Wong, founder of the Yellow Ribbon Project and Dads for Life movement.</p>

<br>NYJC Galileo provides a transformative experience, nurturing holistic
development and offering unique opportunities.&nbsp; It is a programme
that not only supports students in preparing for their future but also
encourages them to develop a reflective mindset and a deeper understanding
of their aspirations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The advice I received from my mentor throughout the programme instilled
in me a reflective mindset and provided personalised guidance relevant
to my interests. This mindset allowed me to leverage on the multitude of
opportunities presented to me throughout my journey in NYJC. Even today,
it enables me to derive meaningful lessons from the various activities
I participate in. Despite the hectic life of a student, the mentoring sessions
I had helped me shift my attention beyond academics. Aware of my interest
in psychology, my mentor provided valuable insights into potential career
paths that would not typically be explored in a classroom setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The many informative sharing sessions and opportunities, covering a wide
range of topics, provided a platform for me to consider the various career
paths. In my first year, I participated in the Criminal Behavioural Analysis
Competition, which exposed me to a unique field of psychology. The sharing
by then principal, Mr. Low Chun Meng, on public service also introduced
me to a career that could integrate both my leadership experiences and
my interest in psychology. Through these exposures to multiple future pathways,
I was able to make an informed and confident decision about my direction,
ultimately leading to a scholarship in the public service.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Darren’s reflection on NYJC Galileo</strong>
</p>
<p>NYJC Galileo, in my opinion, can be summed up in one word: Opportunity.</p>
<p>That was why I signed up for the programme, right after Orientation, despite
hearing seniors' accounts of how hectic junior college life was going to
get. I wanted to see more, do more, and take away an experience richer
than the average junior college student's. Of course, obtaining a scholarship
upon graduation was an aim of mine, but I'd decided that, scholarship or
not, the opportunities in themselves were already worthwhile experiences.</p>
<p>From talks by overseas universities, SATs and interview workshops, to
the National Day Rally, MINDEF Internship Programme and a six-month community
leadership programme with Braddell-Heights CCC, SDP provided me with so
many different opportunities that I would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere.</p>
<p>Beyond the opportunities provided, the teachers in NYJC Galileo Committee
imbued in me the belief that I could compete with the best of them. Indeed,
as I look back, I would have been a rather different individual if not
for NYJC Galileo. As a parting shot, I just want to say that the opportunities
will always be there, and in fact continue to increase, but whether you
let them slip past or make the most of them in your two years in Nanyang
Junior College – the decision is for you to make.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Justin’s reflection on NYJC Galileo</strong>
<br>Kurt Hahn, the founder of Outward Bound School, once said: “There is more
in us than we know if we could be made to see it; perhaps, for the rest
of our lives we will be unwilling to settle for less.” Many Outward Bound
schools use that quote to describe how their programmes change people’s
lives for the better. Well, I could safely say the same for my experience
in NYJC Galileo.</p>
<p>Being in NYJC Galileo has certainly exposed me to many things. The myriad
of programmes, ranging from SAT Training to Personal Grooming workshops,
had taught me many things which mere academic study could not. I have matured
and become an analytical individual due to the talks that NYJC Galileo
sends its students for. One example is the Temasek Dialogue held annually
which discusses many issues such as the growth, sustainability and development
of Singapore’s defence.</p>
<p>Moreover, one of the plus points about NYJC Galileo is its dedicated and
effective team of teachers. The teachers in NYJC Galileo Committee will
always go the extra mile to help their students. I was one of those who
benefitted from their constant coaching.I remember that I was an individual
who was really nervous and fidgety whenever it came to public speaking
or interview sessions. The teachers would arrange mock interview sessions
to better prepare me for interviews. The numerous coaching sessions have
paid off as I have become a more confident individual who no longer stammers
during interviews.</p>
<p>Lastly, my word of advice for those who are interested in being part of
or who wish to find out more about NYJC Galileo: The two years in Junior
College are crucial to your development. Joining NYJC Galileo is opening
up a window of opportunity for you to become a more informed and mature
individual. I made that step to join NYJC Galileo three years ago when
I first stepped into Nanyang Junior College and to date, I have not regretted
my choice as it developed me holistically. Even in National Service, I
find the skills I learnt useful and applicable. In view of this, I hope
that you will be able to benefit from joining NYJC Galileo, just like I
did.</p>
