<p>Every year in July, NYJCians who have exhibited outstanding character,
academic achievement and leadership potential, are invited into one of
the most prestigious programmes in the college - NYJC Galileo. A top-student
development programme, NYJC Galileo aspires to help students develop values
and skills and become active global citizens who are keen to contribute
to society as they learn to stretch their potential in life. To achieve
this aim, NYJC Galileo partners with different Co-Curricular Activities,
college committees and external organisations, to organise and coordinate
a range of workshops and activities throughout the year to cater to the
needs of different students.
<br>
</p>
<p>Some highlights of the year include the Crafting my Story of Self workshop,
where Year One Galileo students learnt to define their values and strengths
through the articulation of stories, through which they communicate to
their peers who they are and what matters most to them, and the Galileo
Fire-side Chat, held in May in college. During the Fire-side Chat, two
NYJC Galileo alumni, Ms Megan Teo (SMU Business Administration with double
major in Global Asia / Lee Kong Chian Scholars Programme) and Mr Tan Ting
Hui (NUS Computer Engineering / NUS Global Merit Scholarship) shared with
our students about their undergraduate lives, the importance of curating
personal development, and the pros and cons of scholarships.
<br>
</p>
<p>Hoping to inspire and motivate students, various leaders in society -
entrepreneurs, poets and company directors were invited to share their
journey in achieving success in their different areas of passion under
our Leadership Series. Last year, we had the privilege of having an alumnus,
Mr Alfie Lim share with us his leadership experiences practicing law in
a leading local and subsequently US law firm, and eventually joining the
Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to work on law and regulatory reform
in financial services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From March to July every year, two teams of Year Two Galileo students
were also involved in the our Community Leadership Programme (CLP). A six-month
long student-leadership programme, the CLP provides a range of experiences
to participants, such as sharings by the Social Service Office and Serangoon
Moral Family Service Centre. Through these involvement, participants plan
and carry out a project to improve the lives of residents in the Braddell
Heights community. Besides providing service to the wider community, the
CLP also helps students develop qualities such as empathy, flexibility
and teamwork. Last year, after consulting block advisors and grassroots
leaders, one team organised Project Under the Stars - an astronomy-themed
block party with the NTU Astronomy Club to promote family bonding. Featuring
stargazing booths, a family constellation walk, and dinner under the stars,
the Galileo students received glowing feedback as residents enjoyed their
first hands-on astronomy experience together.</p>

<p>NYJC Galileo provides a transformative experience, nurturing holistic
development and offering unique opportunities.&nbsp; It is a programme
that not only supports students in preparing for their future but also
encourages them to develop a reflective mindset and a deeper understanding
of their aspirations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The advice I received from my mentor throughout the programme instilled
in me a reflective mindset and provided personalised guidance relevant
to my interests. This mindset allowed me to leverage on the multitude of
opportunities presented to me throughout my journey in NYJC. Even today,
it enables me to derive meaningful lessons from the various activities
I participate in. Despite the hectic life of a student, the mentoring sessions
I had helped me shift my attention beyond academics. Aware of my interest
in psychology, my mentor provided valuable insights into potential career
paths that would not typically be explored in a classroom setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The many informative sharing sessions and opportunities, covering a wide
range of topics, provided a platform for me to consider the various career
paths. In my first year, I participated in the Criminal Behavioural Analysis
Competition, which exposed me to a unique field of psychology. The sharing
by then principal, Mr. Low Chun Meng, on public service also introduced
me to a career that could integrate both my leadership experiences and
my interest in psychology. Through these exposures to multiple future pathways,
I was able to make an informed and confident decision about my direction,
ultimately leading to a scholarship in the public service.</p>

<p>For me, the Galileo programme was a journey of self-discovery. Along the
way, I was introduced to the workings of the Public Service through the
various leadership seminars and small-group dialogue sessions with school
leaders organised for Galileo members. I was also paired with a mentor
who gave me concrete directions I needed to take to apply for the Public
Service Scholarship. In my application, former principal, Mr Low and other
school leaders provided me with one-on-one mentoring to expand my understanding
of what it means to serve in public office. I am extremely grateful for
these moments and the dedicated staff in charge of the Galileo programme,
as they have shaped my worldview and primed me to consider life after JC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The programme developed me holistically, allowing me to understand that
my role as a student transcends the academic context, and extends to my
wider community. There are many opportunities to engage with community
stakeholders, and to be more in tune with society through the course of
the programme. If there were one takeaway from the programme, it would
be servant leadership. We must be careful not to exercise a form of self-serving
leadership that detracts from the needs of people on the ground. The Galileo
programme has enabled me to be a more perceptive leader, and more importantly,
a more concerned member of society.</p>
