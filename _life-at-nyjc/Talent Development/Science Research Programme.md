<p>NYJC Science Research Programme aims to support students in exploring
science, technology and engineering applications beyond the classroom.
We hope to inculcate a strong culture of exploration, innovation and excellence
in our students. This would prepare them to be future leaders in science
research.</p>
<p>Selected students will be given opportunities to develop their interest
and deepen their learning in various fields. They would be mentored by
our teachers, in collaboration with our partners in local research and
academic institutions.</p>
