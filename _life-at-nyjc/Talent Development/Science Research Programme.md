NYJC Science Research Programme aims to support students in exploring science, technology and engineering applications beyond the classroom. We hope to inculcate a strong culture of exploration, innovation and excellence in our students. This would prepare them to be future leaders in science research.

[Selected](/srp/NUS)  students will be given opportunities to develop their interest and deepen their learning in various fields. They would be mentored by our teachers, in collaboration with our partners in local research and academic institutions.
