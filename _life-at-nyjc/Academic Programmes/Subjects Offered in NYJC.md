Elective Programme and Art Elective Programme</h2><p>In addition to the above, NYJC also offers both the Chinese Language Elective Programme (<strong>CLEP</strong>) and the Art Elective Programme (<strong>AEP</strong>).</p><p><strong>The Programme Requirements</strong></p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP)</strong></p></li></ol><p>Applicants must have good results in the GCE ‘O’ Level Examination, obtaining at least:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>B3 in Higher Chinese (alternatively B4 in Higher Chinese and B3 in Chinese Literature),</p></li><li><p>OR A2 in Chinese,</p></li><li><p>OR The equivalent of the above based on IP school internal assessment.</p></li></ul><ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Art Elective Programme (AEP)</strong></p></li></ol><p>Students can expect to offer H2 and H3 Art at GCE A-Level. The H3 Art syllabus complements the H2 Art Syllabus, providing students who have exceptional interest and ability with opportunities to be engaged in the Theory of Art.</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Entry Requirements for AEP</p></li></ul><p>Students who wish to do Art at the H2 &amp; H3 levels are required to sit for a Drawing &amp; Painting Test and a Written Test administered by NYJC AEP Unit to assess their aptitude for the course. Students are also required to attend an interview and present their portfolio.</p><p>Students can find out more about the elective programmes at https://www.moe.gov.sg/programmes/</p><p><strong>The persons-in-charge of the programmes in NYJC</strong></p><p>Language Elective Programme (Chinese): tan_choon_yan@moe.edu.sg</p><p>Art Elective Programme: sim_kim_hong@moe.edu.sg</p><p>Please remember to include your name, school and an email address so that we can reply to your query.</p><h2>More about H3 Level</h2><p>Our college offers H3 subjects to able JC1 students based on their JC1 results. An H3 subject is an extension of the H2 subject and it entails an in-depth study of a particular area that the student has the ability for and a passionate interest in.</p><p>There are 3 modes in which the H3 subject can be taken:</p><p><strong>a) <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-a-level" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE-developed examinable syllabus</a></strong></p><p><strong>b) An extended research project</strong></p><p>Students offering the research mode should work under the supervision of a qualified mentor. Besides school teachers, students could also carry out their research under the mentorship of experts from agencies/institutions, e.g. Agency For Science, Technology &amp; Research (A*STAR), Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) or Singapore Institutes of Higher Learning.</p><p>The curriculum could involve consultation with mentors, attachment to the MOE agency, independent work and preparation for the report/essay.</p><p>To ensure the rigour of the research in the chosen field of study, students would spend at least 50% of the curriculum time on the research process.</p><p>The assessment of students’ research work will be based on the research process and the completed product.</p><p>Students may apply for the Nanyang Research Programme (NRP) offered by NTU, which is convertible to a H3 module, in mid May.</p><p><strong>c) A university-taught course</strong></p><p>The mode of a university-taught course would build on the existing H2 knowledge and skills, allowing students to pursue the subject at a higher and deeper level. It would provide students with opportunities for exploration into a specialised area of focus beyond the scope of the H2 subject, as well as to apply concepts learnt in the study.</p><p>Universities are given the flexibility to design the structure of the H3 programme and the mode of delivery. The curriculum could include lectures, tutorials, field trips and independent work by students. The lessons would be conducted by a qualified university lecturer with the requisite knowledge.</p><p>The assessment of students’ learning could be based on a written examination and/or other components such as laboratory work, evidenced by clear documentation of the learning process.</p><p>H3 subjects offered by the universities may change from year to year. Students will be informed of the H3 modules offered once the universities release the list to the school in October every year.</p><p><strong>Our college will advise students accordingly on the appropriate subjects and modules.</strong></p>
