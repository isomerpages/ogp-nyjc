The JC curriculum is a 2-year course leading to GCE'A' level examination, designed for students who wish to pursue a university degree thereafter.

<h1>Course Information</h1>

**The revised 'A' level curriculum**

In 2006, a new 'A' level curriculum was introduced in order to encourage breadth of learning and flexibility. 'A' level subjects can now be taken at 3 levels: H1, H2 and H3.

H1 level (1 academic unit per H1 subject)
* Half of H2 in terms of curriculum time

H2 level (2 academic unit per H2 subject)
* Equivalent to what was previously termed A-Level subjects

H3 level (1 academic unit per H3 subject)
* Subjects with diverse learning opportunities for in-depth study (e.g. advanced content, research paper, university module).  Students must read the corresponding subject at H2 level.

<h2>Core H1 subjects</h2>

The following subjects are compulsory and will be taken at H1 level:

1. **Mother Tongue Language(MTL)**, which is examined at the end of JC 1. It cannot be replaced by another subject. (A student who achieves grade D7 or better in Higher MTL at O-level is exempted from H1 MTL)
2. **Project Work(PW)**, is examined in JC 1.
3. **General Paper**, is examined at the end of JC 2.

In addition to the core H1 subjects, students must offer at least 4 content-based subjects.

**Content-based subjects**

* In addition to the GP, PW and MTL, students must read at least four content-based subjects.

* Three of the content-based subjects must be at the H2 level and the fourth content-based subject may be at the H1 or H2 level.

**Contrasting subjects**

* At least one of the four content-based subjects read must be a contrasting subject.
* Students specialising in Humanities and the Arts will need to read a contrasting subject from Mathematics and Sciences.
* Students specialising in Mathematics and Sciences will need to read a contrasting subject from Humanities and the Arts.
* The contrasting subject can be read at either the H1 or H2 level.

**Subjects in NYJC**

<h2> Chinese Language Elective Programme and Art Elective Programme</h2>

In addition to the above, NYJC also offers both the Chinese Language Elective Programme (**CLEP**) and the Art Elective Programme (**AEP**).

**The Programme Requirements**

1. **Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP)**

Applicants must have good results in the GCE ‘O’ Level Examination, obtaining at least:

* B3 in Higher Chinese (alternatively B4 in Higher Chinese and B3 in Chinese Literature),
* OR A2 in Chinese,
* OR The equivalent of the above based on IP school internal assessment.

2. Art Elective Programme (AEP)

Students can expect to offer H2 and H3 Art at GCE A-Level. The H3 Art syllabus complements the H2 Art Syllabus, providing students who have exceptional interest and ability with opportunities to be engaged in the Theory of Art.

* Entry Requirements for AEP

Students who wish to do Art at the H2 & H3 levels are required to sit for a Drawing & Painting Test and a Written Test administered by NYJC AEP Unit to assess their aptitude for the course. Students are also required to attend an interview and present their portfolio.

Students can find out more about the elective programmes at https://www.moe.gov.sg/programmes/

<h2> More about H3 Level </h2>

Our college offers H3 subjects to able JC1 students based on their JC1 results.  An H3 subject is an extension of the H2 subject and it entails an in-depth study of a particular area that the student has the ability for and a passionate interest in.

There are 3 modes in which the H3 subject can be taken:

**a)      [MOE-developed examinable syllabus](https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-a-level)**

**b)      An extended research project**

Students offering the research mode should work under the supervision of a qualified mentor.  Besides school teachers, students could also carry out their research under the mentorship of experts from agencies/institutions, e.g. Agency For Science, Technology & Research (A*STAR), Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) or Singapore Institutes of Higher Learning.

The curriculum could involve consultation with mentors, attachment to the MOE agency, independent work and preparation for the report/essay.

To ensure the rigour of the research in the chosen field of study, students would spend at least 50% of the curriculum time on the research process.

The assessment of students’ research work will be based on the research process and the completed product.

Students may apply for the Nanyang Research Programme (NRP) offered by NTU, which is convertible to a H3 module, in mid May.

**c)  A university-taught course**

The mode of a university-taught course would build on the existing H2 knowledge and skills, allowing students to pursue the subject at a higher and deeper level.  It would provide students with opportunities for exploration into a specialised area of focus beyond the scope of the H2 subject, as well as to apply concepts learnt in the study.

Universities are given the flexibility to design the structure of the H3 programme and the mode of delivery. The curriculum could include lectures, tutorials, field trips and independent work by students.  The lessons would be conducted by a qualified university lecturer with the requisite knowledge.

The assessment of students’ learning could be based on a written examination and/or other components such as laboratory work, evidenced by clear documentation of the learning process.

H3 subjects offered by the universities may change from year to year.  Students will be informed of the H3 modules offered once the universities release the list to the school in October every year.


**Our college will advise students accordingly on the appropriate subjects and modules. **
