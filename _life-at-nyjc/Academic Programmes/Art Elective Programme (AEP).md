<p>The Art Elective Programme (AEP) is a 2-year programme offered in selected
junior colleges that allows students with artistic potential, aptitude
and passion to pursue an in-depth study of art. The AEP curriculum aims
to develop students as practitioners, scholars, advocates and leaders in
the arts. All pre-university AEP students offer H2 and H3 Art at A-level
which aim to develop in each student:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an inquiring mind and the confidence to express artistic intent through
visual language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>visual literacy and critical thinking skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an active imagination and a spirit of experimentation and adaptation to
discover creative possibilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>artistic agency and capacity for reflective and collaborative practice
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an understanding of and readiness to embrace diverse perspectives in art
from a range of local and global contexts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Our AEP at NYJC supports both individual artistic growth and collaborative
learning. The programme balances artistic practice with theoretical study,
encouraging students to explore their personal thoughts and emotions through
meaningful artistic expressions across diverse media. Students benefit
from a breadth of authentic learning experiences, including inter-school
workshops that foster creative exchange and immersive learning journeys
that extend their artistic perspectives beyond the classroom. In addition,
our dedicated focus on community engagement equips students to use art
as a powerful tool for social connection and impact.</p>
<p>Our AEP students also join the Art Club where they gain further artistic
experiences through art workshops and competitions while developing important
skills such as leadership and teamwork by organising art-related events.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility &amp; Selection</strong>
</p>
<p>Students do not need any prior art experience but must be able to demonstrate
artistic potential and aptitude through a personal art portfolio.</p>
<p>Interested students are required to sit for a school-based diagnostic
test to assess their suitability for the programme. The diagnostic test
consists of a creative task and a portfolio interview.</p>
