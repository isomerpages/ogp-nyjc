<h1> Art </h1>

Nanyang JC offers the Art Elective Programme. Our art programme places equal emphasis on both the practical and theoretical aspects of art making, encouraging students to explore their thoughts, feelings and ideas through a variety of art practices and processes. Through the study of Art, students will acquire skills such as research, experimentation and exploration, idea development, personal reflection and evaluation through the process of creating and discussing artworks.

In JC1, AEP students will go through a series of modules, exposing them to different types of art making, for example, drawing, painting, photography, sculpture, design, video, et cetera.

In JC2, AEP students will embark on their ‘A’ Level coursework for 9 months, choosing their own area of specialisation. During this time, students will be guided by their tutors through one-to-one consultation.

AEP students at NYJC can also look forward to exciting combined-schools art workshops, artist talks, competitions, learning journeys to museums and institutes of higher learning. They will also have the chance to go on an overseas art immersion trip to broaden their exposure and deepen their engagement with art.

<h2> H2 Art </h2>

The H2 Level Art syllabus emphasises the development of visual literacy as well as critical and creative thinking by encouraging personal responses to art making and appreciation. Through the Studio Practice (practical component) and the Study of Visual Arts (theoretical component), students learn to create, respond to and interpret artworks.

<h2>H3 Art</h2>

The H3 Level Art syllabus complements the H2 Level Art syllabus by engaging students in the study of Theory of Art. It engages students in theoretical and critical discourses of Art in the way it is perceived, defined and practised. It lays a foundation for academic engagement in Art at the tertiary level.

Note: It is compulsory for all AEP students to read H3 Art in JC2.

**Selection Test**

All students interested to study Art are required to sit for a Drawing & Painting Test and a Written Test administered by the AEP teachers to assess their aptitude for the course. Students are also required to attend an interview and present their portfolio. Upon successful admission to the course, students will be automatically placed in the Art Elective Programme.
