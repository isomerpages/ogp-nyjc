NYCal is a SIG established in 2016 to expand the artistic capabilities of NYJCians. Through a wide range of activities, the group hopes to bring life to the words and phrases we write. The monthly calligraphy session aims to help members explore their own style of writing and further venture into calligraphy. These calligraphy workshops are conducted by the exco members. Other than learning basic brush strokes, there are also different themes (e.g. Bullet Journals) set for each session to explore other areas in which calligraphy can be put to use.

They are also involved in card sales during annual events such as Teachers’ Day and Valentine’s Day. Their products were highly popular.
