“Music was a vector we wanted to build a universe around” (Thomas Bangalter, Daft Punk)

Have you ever wondered what goes behind the scenes in making the songs we listen to every day?

Nanyang Music Production was formed in 2022 by music enthusiasts who wanted to share the art of music production. In Nanyang Music Production, all members get to express themselves by making music using Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software. We produce music of various genres, from pop to electronic dance music (EDM). Sharing sessions are held to help members better understand music theory and to improve their music production skills.

Members will get opportunities to produce music for school videos. They can also release their own music under their own names. Regardless of skill level, Nanyang Music Production is the place for you to hone your music production skills.
