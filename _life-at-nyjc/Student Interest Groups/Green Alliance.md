In the past century, our planet has seen huge changes to the environment. Most of them are sadly caused by our excessive consumption and irresponsible behaviour.

Established in 2020, The Green Alliance aims to protect Mother Earth from further degradation through our 3-pronged approach: education, action and feedback.

We aim to educate the student body about various environment related issues such as the huge fabric wastage generated when we throw old clothes away. We hold seasonal clothing and pen drives to provide a platform for students to do their part to protect their environment. We also seek the views of the student body to see how we can better craft our projects to meet their interest while protecting the world we live in.

We meet fortnightly to discuss projects and how we can improve our approach to serving the environment and student body.
