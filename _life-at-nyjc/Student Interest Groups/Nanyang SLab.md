Nanyang S.Lab is where the members get to play Mad Scientist and create their own Slime.  It is a fun and safe activity (our processes are non-toxic), and is a great stress-reliever.  Developing unique new variations of slime (such as changing colour and texture) also encourages creativity as the members share their latest inventions with their friends.

S.Lab takes place during common lunch periods.  They welcome anyone to join them in making their own slime. If you are interested in making slime or looking for a creative outlet to relax and unwind, Nanyang S.Lab could be the SIG for you!
