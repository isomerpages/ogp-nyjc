“If you watch a game, it’s fun. If you play it, it’s recreation…” – Bob Hope

The Ministry of Recreational Games (MORG) was founded by five recreational games enthusiasts. As a Chinese saying goes, “休息是为了走更长远的路。” It means taking a short break prepares us for the long journey that lies ahead of us.

To many, recreational games appear to only entertain. However, MORG feels that recreational games also help in forging close friendships and imparting essential life skills. While studies are indeed important, it is also necessary for one to put aside time for fun.  Strike a work-life balance.  Join MORG.

MORG hosts gaming sessions every Wednesday from 3:30pm to 5:30pm.
