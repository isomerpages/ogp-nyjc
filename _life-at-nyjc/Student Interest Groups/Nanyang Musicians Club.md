The Nanyang Musicians Club, known affectionately as NYMC, was created in 2012 and is sustained by avid music lovers in the college. Members get together to form performing bands, enabling the members to gain greater insights into the inner workings of a live band.  

Performances by NYMC are always well-received by the audience! NYMC is a regular at school-related events such as Teacher's Day, National Day, Chinese New Year and the annual Open House. Apart from school performances, NYMC also takes part in many ad-hoc performances out of school. Some of the previous engagements include 'Concert-Uncaged' to raise funds for the Children Cancer Foundation and 'Tighten the Knots', a service-learning project in collaboration with NYJC Interact Club and 'Project Meliora' to raise funds for pediatric cancer patients.
