<p>The Nanyang Musicians Club, known affectionately as NYMC, was founded
in 2012 and is sustained by avid music lovers in the college. Members come
together to form performing bands, gaining greater insights into the dynamics
and inner workings of a live band.</p>
<p>NYMC bands have opportunities to perform regularly in school events such
as Teacher’s Day, National Day, Chinese New Year and the annual Open House,
and are always well received by the audience.&nbsp; Beyond school performances,
NYMC also takes part in many ad-hoc performances outside of school.</p>
<p>Most recently, NYMC was involved in planning the school CarNYval’s musical-esque
performance alongside Student Council, bringing lively music and dance
to the stage, and showcasing the club’s energy both on and behind the scenes.</p>
