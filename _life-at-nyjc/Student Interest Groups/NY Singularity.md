In Nanyang, there is a group of students who is fascinated by the beauty of Physics. That is us. We are all genuinely passionate about Physics and would always spend extra-curricular time exploring more about Physics, studying it beyond the junior college syllabus, including more sophisticated topics like QUANTUM, RELATIVITY, COSMOLOGY and NUCLEAR PHYSICS. As we think the fun of doing it will be multiplied if we form a group of Physics lovers and do it together, we came up with the idea of starting this SIG. We hope to have a session regularly so that we can gather and appreciate the fun of Physics together, including introducing new Physics concepts to groups, sharing Physics knowledge, innovative ideas and solving complex problems together. Through working together in this SIG, we hope to achieve the purpose of bringing each other to new intellectual heights in Physics.
