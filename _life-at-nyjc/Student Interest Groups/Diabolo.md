Looking for something new and interesting? Join NY Diabolo! An SIG unique to NYJC! Start and develop your new passion with your fellow friends.

NY Diabolo started with a group of friends with similar interest who like playing the Diabolo and wish to spread the joy to others. Members get to perform at different events, building up their confidence and also showcase their creativity through choreographing their own performance

NY Diabolo also offers a fun and simple way for students to relax themselves. Be a teacher and a learner in this SIG as members get to teach and learn cool and interesting tricks from one another. Activities will be held once a week to practice for upcoming performances or just simply to for recreation.
