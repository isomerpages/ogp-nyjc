<p>The ASEAN Literacy Club (NYASEAN) is a vibrant Student Interest Group
(SIG) at Nanyang Junior College that celebrates the rich and diverse cultures
of Southeast Asia. Rooted in the spirit of unity and regional appreciation,
NYASEAN provides a welcoming platform for students to explore the traditions,
histories, and shared experiences of ASEAN countries.</p>
<p>Through engaging activities such as cultural exchange circles, film screenings,
and language workshops, NYASEAN brings ASEAN stories and perspectives to
life. We also contribute to key college events like Racial Harmony Day
and ASEAN Day, showcasing regional heritage through traditional attire,
games, music, and interactive displays. These experiences promote cross-cultural
understanding and encourage meaningful interactions among students from
all walks of life.</p>
<p>Whether you come from an ASEAN background or are simply curious to learn
more, NYASEAN invites you to join a community that celebrates diversity,
encourages dialogue, and builds bridges between cultures.</p>
<p>Come explore, express, and engage with us - and be part of a journey that
connects nations, traditions, and people.</p>
