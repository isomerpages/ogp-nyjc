Alchemists from medieval times brewed elemental gold magically. Today, modern scientists are able to synthesise novel substances through chemical reactions. Chemistry reveals insights to various natural phenomena and man-made decisions in the chemical industry. Â At NY Alchemy, we want to understand what goes on behind these reactions at the molecular level and the various concepts governing how they proceed.

Our once-a-week session focuses on sharing material that both reinforce Chemistry taught in school as well as explore content outside the textbook.
