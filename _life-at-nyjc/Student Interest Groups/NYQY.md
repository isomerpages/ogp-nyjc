Are you a big fan of stand-up comedy and talk shows? Do you love traditional Chinese culture at the same time? You can enjoy both at the special space that our SIG has come up with. Nanyang QUYI is the place where you can learn with fun and passion!

QUYI includes two fundamental sections: Chinese opera and cross talk (相声, a traditional form of Chinese comedy). During our regular sessions, you will be guided through a series of programmes that would allow you to appreciate Chinese cultural elements such as Hanfu (汉服), traditional musical instruments, and tea arts. Wondering about performing opportunities to showcase your talents? Our annual performance provides a perfect stage for you to train your organisational skills and enrich your JC experience. With that, we are looking forward to seeing you around! 此致，下台鞠躬！
