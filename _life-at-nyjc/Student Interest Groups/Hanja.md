Do you like watching Korean drama and listening to K-pop? Is your enjoyment marred by an inability to understand the language?

Hanja Club is a Student Interest Group (SIG) for NYJCians who are interested in learning the Korean language and getting to know the Korean culture.

Our SIG aims to spread the love for the culture and ensure that every member leaves Nanyang knowing how to speak conversational Korean. We wish to embolden every member to share their interests and expand their knowledge in Hanja Club.

So feel free to join us on our weekly adventures into the world of Korean culture.
