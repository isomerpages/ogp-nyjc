<p>Paws on Parade (POP) is a Student Interest Group (SIG) that connects NYJCians
who share an interest in animal welfare, conservation and advocacy.</p>
<p>Through a range of activities including volunteering sessions, educational
sharings, and collaborations with various animal welfare organisations,
members gain exposure to real-world animal welfare issues, while learning
how they can contribute meaningfully to the cause.</p>
<p>POP aims to cultivate empathy, responsibility, deepen students’ understanding
of animals around us, and inspire informed, compassionate action.</p>
<p>There are also many opportunities for members to be actively involved
beyond discussions and learning. Members participate in volunteering initiatives,
educational events and school-based activities such as the SIG bazaar and
carNYval.</p>
<p>POP welcomes all students who wish to make a tangible difference for animals
while developing leadership, teamwork, and advocacy skills.</p>
