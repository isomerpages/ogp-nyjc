Paws On Parade is a group of students who would like to give back to society via caring for strays in Singapore.  Partnering with dog shelters such as Save Our Street Dogs (SOSD), the members are committed to help in the rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming of stray dogs (and other strays).  They organise cleaning sessions at dog shelters during the school holidays, and also take the initiative to educate their college mates about these shelters, and encourage them to be a volunteer. 

They hope to inspire more people to commit to supporting the shelters and the saving of the strays on a longer-term basis.
