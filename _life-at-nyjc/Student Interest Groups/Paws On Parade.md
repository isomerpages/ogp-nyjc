<p class=""><span class="">European Society (ES) is an SIG formed by a group of Europhiles who are interested in everything concerning Europe. Are you interested in picking up a new European language, such as German or French? Then ES is for you! Members of ES are also treated to interesting facts about Europe at the end of every language lesson.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">ES members also meet with people from external European organisations, like Goethe Institut, Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise de Singapour and the British Council. Have you heard of animation festivals or film premiers held by these institutions? If you have not, then don&rsquo;t worry, for ES will update latest news for those who are interested!</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">Members of ES meet once per week. For week A, it&rsquo;s during the J1 Common Lunch. For week B, it&rsquo;s between 16:30 and 17:30.
