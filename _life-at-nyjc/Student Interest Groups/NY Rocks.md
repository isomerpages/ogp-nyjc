<p>NY Rocks is NYJC’s in-house Geography Student Interest Group, established
in 2024 to unite passionate geography enthusiasts eager to explore the
wonders of our world. It offers a platform for students to dive deeper
into geographic topics beyond the classroom, nurturing curiosity, critical
thinking, and a deeper appreciation of our environment.</p>
<p>Through a diverse range of activities, including fun GeoGuessr sessions
for members to explore the geographies of the world, field studies, and
discussions on pressing global issues such as climate change, urban development,
and sustainable resource management, NY Rocks bridges theory with real-world
applications. Members gain a richer understanding of the intricate connections
between people, places, and the environment. We aspire to collaborate with
industry professionals and organizations, creating future opportunities
for students to participate in competitions, internships, and meaningful
Geography-related events.</p>
<p>Whether you’re captivated by natural landscapes, fascinated by urban planning,
or driven by a passion for sustainability, NY Rocks is the place to share
ideas, explore interests, and make a meaningful impact.</p>
