<p>The Nanyang Competitive Programming Club (NYCP) is a Special Interest
Group (SIG) set up by computer science enthusiasts. We provide a platform
for everyone to express their creativity through code.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>NYCP sessions are conducted in the form of lessons, as well as discussions
around interesting problems and puzzles. Outside of our bi-weekly sessions,
we participate in weekly contests and discuss intriguing problems online!
Our members also take part in numerous coding competitions such as the
National Olympiad in Informatics, CodeQuest and the Oxford University Computing
Challenge.
<br>
<br>Furthermore, NYCP hosts the annual Nanyang Olympiad in Informatics (NYOI),
allowing students to challenge themselves with algorithmic puzzles. In
addition, we organise the yearly Competitive Programming Introductory Course
(CPIC), an outreach programme catered for secondary school students, as
well as our fellow NYJCians.
<br>
<br>Whether you are in search of a new skill to master, or looking to express
your creativity through code, NYCP offers a supportive community and engaging
sessions, to help you excel in competitive programming. Join us now to
unleash your potential in the exciting world of technology!</p>
