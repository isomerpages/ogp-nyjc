<p>“Science can amuse and fascinate us all, but it is engineering that changes
the world.”</p>
<p>~Issac Asimov</p>
<p>Engineering drives innovation by creating practical solutions to complex
problems. It bridges scientific principles with real-world applications,
enabling advancements in technology, medicine, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The EngiNYeering SIG is a Student Interest Group that caters to all students
who have an interest in any field of engineering. EngiNYeering strives
to be a hub that brings together students that have a passion and heart
for engineering. At our SIG, we hold sessions once every two weeks where
we discuss topics ranging from aerospace to automobile engineering. Members
can suggest topics that they are interested in to be discussed in sessions,
and even present.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a place to discuss, learn, and interact with people
that have a similar passion for engineering, join EngiNYeering!</p>
