Heard of chromatography? What is a superbug? Why are some cancers harder to treat than others?

Here at NYBioNat, we delve deeper into the biological concepts that you might already be familiar with, as well as explain the “why” and the “how” behind them.

At our bi-weekly sessions, not only will you find out more about various topics through our student presenters, but we also conduct fun experiments so that you can have a hands-on learning experience of the wide range of topics we cover.

Feel free to join us if you share our interest in biology!
