<p>Heard of chromatography? What is a superbug? Why are some cancers harder
to treat than others?</p>
<p>At NYBioNat, we delve deeper into the biological concepts you may already
be familiar with, and explore the “why” and the “how” behind them.</p>
<p>In our bi-weekly sessions, you’ll learn about a wide range of topics through
our student-led presentations and take part in fun experiments that offer
hands-on learning.</p>
<p>Beyond discussions and experiments, NYBioNat also offers research opportunities.
Members can choose to join one of our faculties, such as Cardiology, Psychiatry
&amp; Psychology, and Neurology, and collaborate to publish an article
in our annual MedHealth Journal. NYBionat also runs Medipedia, where members
can independently research topics of interest and create informative articles
to be shared on our Instagram platform.</p>
<p>You will also have opportunities to volunteer at hospitals and rehabilitation
centres, gaining exposure to real-world healthcare settings and a better
understanding of the practical side of medicine and biology.</p>
