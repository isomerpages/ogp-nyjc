<p>Dreamt of performing your favourite Korean idol’s songs on stage?</p>
<p>Join Korzy!</p>
<p>Korzy is NYJC’s K-pop Dance Interest Group, formed by students who share
a love for K-pop and performance.</p>
<p>Korzy members learn and cover popular K-pop songs, with choreographies
sometimes adapted to better suit the team. Members learn routines together
and also teach one another. Korzy performs at various school events, including
celebrative occasions, SIG bazaars in collaboration with other SIGs, and
more. It is a must-have presence at the college’s Open House.</p>
<p>Practices are self-initiated, with the performing groups meeting once
or twice weekly, increasing in frequency as performances draw nearer. Occasionally,
Korzy also holds casual bonding sessions to chat and connect over all things
Korean.</p>
<p>Join Korzy and share your passion for K-pop while making new friends!</p>
