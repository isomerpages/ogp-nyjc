Dreamt of performing your favourite Korean idol’s songs on stage? Join Korzy!
Korzy was formed by K-pop fans who enjoy singing and synchronised dancing in a group.

Korzy performers often learn dance routines from the Internet and adapt them for their own dance practices. They would also teach one another the dance routines. They perform at celebrative events, collaborate with other SIGs to organise SIG bazaars and lunchtime concerts.  They are also a must-have at the college’s Open House.

The Korzy SIG meets once or twice weekly, either for the usual dance practice or informal discussions on all things Korean.
