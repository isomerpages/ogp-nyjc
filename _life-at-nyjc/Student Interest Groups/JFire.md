*Ohaiyo, mina-san!* (Hi everyone!)

JFire is a Student Interest Group formed by students interested in all things Japanese. In JFire, members share their knowledge and enthusiasm with regard to J-pop, anime, manga, Japanese cuisine and much more.

The members hold weekly meet-ups every Friday from 4.30pm to 6.30pm. Additionally, they also participate in Lunchtime Concerts and SIG bazaar with other SIGs. They hold their own in-house events such as the Haunted House.  The club also organises visits to Cosfest, Anime Festival Asia (AFA) and other anime conventions in Singapore.
