<p><em>Ohaiyo!</em>
</p>
<p>JFire is a SIG consisting of students interested in the Japanese culture!
In JFire, members share their knowledge and enthusiasm with regard to J-pop,
anime, manga, Japanese cuisine, traditional culture and much more.</p>
<p>JFire holds bi-weekly sessions, typically during NYReach, from 12.30pm
to 1.30pm. Additionally, they frequently participate in school events such
as the annual SIG Bazaar, CarNYval, as well as the Lifeskills &amp; Leadership
Seminar! They also organise their own VIA activities and other in-house
projects, in the hope to promote, preserve and share the joy derived from
the Japanese culture for many years to come.</p>
