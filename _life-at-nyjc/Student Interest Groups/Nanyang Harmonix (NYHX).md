<p>Nanyang Harmonix (NYHX) is an a cappella Student Interest Group (SIG)
bringing fresh energy and voices to Nanyang! Founded in 2024, NYHX was
born out of a love for music and a passion for vocal harmony. Here, it’s
all about creating unforgettable music with just one single instrument
- your voice! We’re on a mission to unite voices, build confidence, and
create standout performances that resonate with the college and the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our practices are where the magic happens! Every two weeks (or more often
when an event’s coming up), we meet to work on unique a cappella arrangements
of popular pop songs chosen by our members. Together, we dive into each
session to make our arrangements come alive! NYHX is excited to perform
at a variety of events, from community club gatherings to Chinese New Year,
Teachers' Day, and more! We’re always ready to take on new opportunities
that come our way!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ready to experience the thrill of harmonising with people who love music
as much as you do? Joining NYHX means getting lost in the joy of singing,
connecting with friends, and being part of something bigger than yourself.
If you’re ready to bring your voice to the stage, NYHX is the group for
you - come sing with us!</p>
