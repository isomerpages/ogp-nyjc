**“Mathematics reveals its beauty only to those who approach it with pure love, for its own beauty”  --  Archimedes (287 – 212 B.C.)**

The Mathematics Club is a Student Interest Group (SIG) run by Mathematics enthusiasts in NYJC!  We provide a platform for students who are kindred spirits to Mathematics, to discuss historical problems or the wildest hypothesis in the Mathematical field. If you are easily fascinated by the tiniest details in life, or passionate about finding patterns in solutions, how the universe works or the ultimate meaning of our lives, we encourage you to become a member of the Mathematics Club. Thinking is breathing.

In addition, if you have any trouble in studying Mathematics, please join us as the Mathematics Club is a place where the solution(s) lies! We also take part in the training of participants of competitions such as the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad.

The Mathematics Club meets on Thursdays.
