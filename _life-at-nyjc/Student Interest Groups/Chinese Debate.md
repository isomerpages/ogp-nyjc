Debating is part of human nature.  Whether it be the fun “chicken and egg” debate or the philosophical “trolley dilemma”, people engage in debates to question assumptions in order to defend their own views and to gain interesting and valuable insights.

Nanyang Chinese Debate is a Student Interest Group (SIG) that provides a platform for Chinese debate lovers to train their oratorical and critical thinking skills. Our training sessions are held twice a month. In our SIG sessions, members discuss various controversial topical issues within a formal debating framework. Members are encouraged to speak up and are trained in active listening skills. Members may also represent the college in national debate competitions such as “Chuang Xian Bei” (创贤杯).
