“Every artist was first an amateur” - Ralph Waldo Emerson.

NYArts was established in 2018 for students to express their creativity in any form or medium of art.  The members have dabbled in paper quilling, chalk, henna drawing, rubber stamp carving, and even shrink plastic jewellery making!  NYArts is a platform to learn and experiment with a diversity of visual, and tactile media; and a showcase of NYJCians’ creation.

Check out their Instagram @nyjc\_art to learn more about what they do.
