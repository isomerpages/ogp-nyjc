<p>“Every artist was first an amateur” - Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p>
<p>NYArts is a Student Interest Group (SIG) that provides a platform for
art lovers, both experienced artists and those just starting out, to express
their creativity across different forms and mediums. Members have explored
paper quilling, chalk art, henna drawing, rubber stamp carving, and even
shrink plastic jewellery-making!&nbsp;</p>
<p>NYArts also offers opportunities for students to showcase their passion
for art through events such as Arts Week, Science Research Day and Racial
Harmony Day.&nbsp;</p>
