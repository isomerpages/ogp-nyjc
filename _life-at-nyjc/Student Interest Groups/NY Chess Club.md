Nanyang Junior College's Chess Club is a meeting of students who are interested in learning and developing their skills in chess, including International Chess, Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) and GO (Weiqi). Participation in competitions are highly encouraged as they serve as platforms for members to practise and hone their skills.

Members meet during the weekly common lunch breaks to train and practise with one another. Training sessions are held in Room 3-39 and members can bring along friends who are keen to learn basic chess. Â Additionally, they can borrow chess boards and pieces outside of training schedule to play with their friends.
