<p>NYThreads is a Student Interest Group (SIG) established in 2023, dedicated
to bringing creativity to life through the art of crafting with threads.
We offer an inclusive and welcoming environment for individuals passionate
about crafting or those eager to explore a new hobby. Through engaging
and interactive sessions, members have the opportunity to create a diverse
range of items, including beaded friendship bracelets, thread bracelets,
embroidery pieces, and more. Whether you are a complete beginner or an
experienced crafter, NYThreads provides a supportive and inspiring community
for all.</p>
<p>A defining feature of NYThreads is its flexible approach, which empowers
participants to learn and develop crafting skills at their own pace. Our
aim is to cultivate a stress-free atmosphere where students can immerse
themselves in the creative process while connecting with like-minded individuals
who share a passion for crafting.</p>
<p>Additionally, we actively encourage members to contribute to the community
by participating in events that involve creating handmade gifts to uplift
and inspire those around us. We are eager to share our remarkable projects
and unique creations with you. To stay informed about our activities and
explore highlights from our past endeavors, follow us on Instagram @nyjcthreads.
