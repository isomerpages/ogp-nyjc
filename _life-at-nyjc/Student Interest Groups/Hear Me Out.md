<p>Hear Me Out (HMO) is a Student Interest Group (SIG) that introduces students
to Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) while building empathy and awareness
for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.</p>
<p>Our biweekly sessions are fun, interactive, and beginner-friendly. Members
learn sign language basics such as letters of the alphabet, common phrases,
and visual gesture communication, all reinforced through games and hands-on
activities. More than just learning a new skill, HMO is about meaningful
communication, inclusivity, and understanding perspectives beyond our own.</p>
<p>This SIG is especially relevant for students interested in medicine, dentistry,
healthcare, education, and other people-centred courses, where strong communication
skills and empathy truly matter. Exposure to sign language and the deaf
community allows members to develop these qualities naturally — experiences
that can be meaningfully reflected on during interviews, MMIs, and portfolio
discussions.</p>
<p>HMO also offers volunteering opportunities through collaborations with
deaf communities. One such collaboration was with Nanyang Technological
University's Regular Service Project: Deaf Community “Learn, Observe, Laugh”event,
where members volunteered as game masters and interacted with Deaf youths
across different age groups. By signing game instructions and communicating
directly with participants, members gain real-life SgSL exposure and a
deeper understanding of the deaf community.</p>
<p>At HMO, every voice matters — whether expressed through voices, hands,
or hearts.</p>
