<p>Nanyang Legal Lions (NYLL) is a student interest group (SIG) aimed at
fostering a deeper understanding of laws, legal systems and the diverse
legal issues that shape societies worldwide.</p>
<p>During our sessions, we engage in thought-provoking discussions on various
law-related topics and organise activities to learn the perspectives of
different stakeholders involved in legal issues. These sessions provide
participants with opportunities to analyse issues critically, form opinions
and collaborate with their peers.</p>
<p>We also research and curate engaging Instagram posts to share interesting
facts about legal issues in order to bring more awareness to these topics.</p>
<p>Our goal is to cultivate critical thinking skills, promote social responsibility
and encourage informed discussions about global and societal issues. Through
NYLL, members gain valuable insights that are not only relevant to real-world
situations but are also useful for academic subjects like General Paper.
Additionally, we provide a platform for students to share their opinions
and learn more about law as a field of study and potential career path.</p>
