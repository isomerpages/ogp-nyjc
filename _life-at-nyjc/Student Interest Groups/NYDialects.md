<p>NYDialects is a Student Interest Group (SIG) dedicated to bridging the
gap between dialects and family! Currently, our members are proficient
in the two major dialects in Singapore: Hokkien and Cantonese. Have you
ever wanted to get in family tea though you might have no idea what's going
on? This is the SIG for you!</p>
<p>We have sessions for teaching phrases, as well as ones for members to
converse in dialects, allowing them to apply their new-found vocabulary
in a casual setting. We also lend&nbsp;</p>
<p>our support to help out in senior activity centres to help get rid of
language barriers between the elderly and the student volunteers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We extend a warm welcome to fellow NYJCians who speak other dialects
to add to our ever-diverse mix of students!</p>
