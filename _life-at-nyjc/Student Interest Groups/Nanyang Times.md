<p>The Nanyang Times (NYTimes) is a Student Interest Group (SIG) that aims
to promote the love of writing and journalism, with many opportunities
to write about things that students are passionate about, from the happenings
within the buzz of our Nanyang campus or global topics that help to cultivate
critical thinking, a key 21st century competency.</p>
<p>There have been chances for students to take their interest in journalism
even further, through learning journeys to media centres to see how they
operate and edit news for the general public. Through our website, we publish
our articles for people to see and keep abreast of everything Nanyang-related
and more</p>
