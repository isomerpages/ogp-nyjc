<p><strong><em>“Words creates worlds.”</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The Writer’s Circle is a SIG set up in 2017 with one overarching goal:
to write. They support and promote literary expression in many forms –
novels, plays, poetry, and even lyrics.</p>
<p>The SIG provides a platform for like-minded students who enjoy creative
writing to interact, collaborate, and create together. Members are supported
through sharing sessions and a welcoming environment that encourages experimentation
and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Writer’s Circle members also participate in writing competitions at various
levels, giving them opportunities to share their original literary work
and stay motivated. Within the college, we promote literary expression
through the organisation of student writing competitions and related activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are looking for a space to express yourself through words, join
Nanyang Writer’s Circle and create alongside other aspiring writers.</p>
