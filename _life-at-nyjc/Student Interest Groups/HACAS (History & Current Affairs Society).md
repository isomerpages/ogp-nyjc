The members of HACAS are keen in gaining a greater understanding of the influences of the past, finding out what makes the world tick and what can stop it in its tracks.

The SIG gathers like-minded people to discuss current affairs and world history, including the philosophy, the languages, the theology and mythology of the old. The members engage in debates and presentations of individual findings.   The members also participate in current affairs competitions (NTU Current Affairs Competition, NUS Chancellorâ€™s Challenge Shield), MUNs (eg. Middle Eastern Summit, Nanyang Technological University Model United Nations and Singapore Model United Nations), and history competitions (International History Bee and Bowl, International History Olympiad).

Sessions are held once every two weeks on Thursdays, at 7pm.
