“Words create worlds.” 

If you have keen interest in stars and planets, join NYAstro! The sky isn’t the limit in our pursuit of understanding what lies beyond our skies. There are many unsolved questions in space which the NYAstro strives to find the answers to.

Our SIG aims to increase appreciation and knowledge about everything related to the Universe. We wish to create a platform for people who are interested in cosmology to share their knowledge and ideas, and promote a love for our universe.

Sessions will revolve around sharing of theories and astronomy-related content. Fun activities are also held each session to encourage hands-on interactive learning. We meet once a month for sessions and we also have stargazing sessions in school and sometimes even at outdoor observatories.
