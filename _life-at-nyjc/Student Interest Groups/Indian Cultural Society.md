<p>The Indian Cultural Society (ICS) is a Student Interest Group (SIG) at
Nanyang Junior College that celebrates the rich heritage of Indian culture
while fostering a sense of community among students. Our SIG serves as
a platform for students to deepen their understanding of Indian traditions,
art forms and history, while bonding them through their shared interests.</p>
<p>We actively contribute to key college events such as Racial Harmony Day,
where we showcase Indian cultural elements through engaging activities
like henna art, traditional games and festive decor. Additionally, our
SIG organises movie nights where members come together to enjoy iconic
Indian films, providing a glimpse into the vibrant storytelling and cinematic
artistry of Indian cinema.</p>
<p>ICS celebrates the vibrancy of Indian traditions by curating meaningful
experiences for the college community. Whether it’s bringing festive cheer
during cultural celebrations or collaborating on college-wide events, we
aim to inspire an appreciation for diversity and provide members with opportunities
to form meaningful connections&nbsp;</p>
<p>ICS&nbsp;offers students a meaningful and enjoyable way to stay connected
to their roots or simply explore the beauty of Indian culture. If you’re
looking for a space to express your creativity, share your experiences
and immerse yourself in cultural learning, this SIG warmly welcomes you!</p>
