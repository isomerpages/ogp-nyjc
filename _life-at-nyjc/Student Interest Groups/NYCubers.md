Ever wondered how to solve a Rubik’s Cube within a minute? Have you ever dreamed of solving it with one hand?  Or blindfolded? The members from NY Cubers can show you how! They don’t stop at the standard 3x3 cube, the members challenge themselves and their friends to solving a variety of other puzzles, such as the 2x2, 4x4, 5x5 and Pyraminx.

NY Cubers was formed by students who wanted to share their passion and enthusiasm for Rubik's Cubes. Its members are dedicated to the endless quest of improving on their cubing skills. They participate in the annual Singapore Cube Championship, which is organised by the National University of Singapore.

Learning how to solve cubes can be vexing at the beginning, but the sweet success of mastery that follows makes it well worth it. What's more, this activity improves one's cognitive and problem solving skills, making it a truly unique and useful hobby.
