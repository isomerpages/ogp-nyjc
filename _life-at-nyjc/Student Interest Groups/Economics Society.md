"Economics is not about goods and services; it is about human choice and action." -- Ludwig von Mises

Economics enables people to comprehend people, businesses, markets and governments, thus better responding to the challenges and opportunities that emerge in the ever-changing world. The NY Economics Society is an assortment of students brought together by their devotion to the subject. The members bond over various economic concepts and firmly believe that economics is found in everyday life. At our SIG, we deliberate ideas about economic models and theories, discover the subtle beauty of this subject and foster a more profound understanding of economics knowledge. Academically engaging sessions are conducted in the form of stimulating games or deep discussions about matters related to economics. Here, students will have a platform to discuss their academic interests and ignite their passion for learning the subject.
