<p><strong>“A feeling to express, a song to sing.”</strong>
</p>
<p>Nanyang Voices is a Student Interest Group for students who have a passion
for Chinese songs. At our fortnightly sessions, everyone is given the opportunity
to sing, as we aim to provide a platform for fans of Chinese music to showcase
their talent and grow in confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members participate in various school events, including the Nyght and
Teachers’ Day. They are also encouraged to participate in external singing
and songwriting competitions.</p>
<p>NY Voices meets once every fortnight, bringing members together to share
a common passion for singing.
