_**"A feeling to express, a song to sing."**_

Nanyang Voices is a Student Interest Group which involves students who have a passion for Chinese songs. In Nanyang Voices, everyone is given the opportunity to sing at the fortnightly sessions. They want to create a platform for fans of Chinese songs to showcase their talent.

The members participate in various events including the Nyght and Teachers’ Day. Members are also encouraged to participate in external singing and song writing competition.  
  

They meet once every fortnight, on a Tuesday, from 4:30pm to 6:30pm.
