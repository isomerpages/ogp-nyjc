<p>Founded in 2024, NY Crescendo (NYCresc) is a dynamic creative platform
for music enthusiasts, aspiring songwriters, and performers to connect
and express themselves through songwriting and music creation. It offers
a safe and interactive space where members explore music across three wings:
Composers' Wing (for music creation), Lyricists' Wing (for writing lyrics),
and Performers' Wing (for stage performance).</p>
<p>NY Crescendo encourages its members to delve into different aspects of
music, collaborate meaningfully, and engage in the full process of song
creation and performance. Members can express their emotions through music
creation in their mother tongues, discovering new avenues for creative
and musical expression in the process.</p>
<p>In NY Crescendo, members have the chance to showcase original works through
various in-college performances, jamming sessions and more. The SIG also
contributes actively to college-wide events, &nbsp;such as creating and
producing theme songs for J1 Orientation. Members are also given the opportunity
to participate in various competitions with their own compositions, gain
exposure, build connections, and learn from a diverse range of musical
styles.</p>
