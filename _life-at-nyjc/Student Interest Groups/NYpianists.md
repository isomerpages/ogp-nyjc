NYpianists is an SIG established in 2018, supported by a group of pianists who want to showcase their talents, and promote a love for music among NYJCians.  The NYpianists is divided into 2 wings - the performing wing and the recreational wing. The performing wing works towards putting up an annual performance and the recreational wing commits to teaching the fundamentals of playing the piano to the members who are new to the instrument.  
  
Their training schedules are flexible.  The members and their mentors / instructors would decide on their respective training sessions based on their individual schedule.  There is a once-a-month meeting where the members discuss about upcoming performances.
