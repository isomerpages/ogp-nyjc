<p>The Class Leaders Executive Committee (CLExco), a top-tier leadership
CCA is made up of 14 class leaders, with a mission to organise college-wide
events and initiatives with a focus on class bonding.</p>
<p>Signature events include the Chinese New Year celebrations (where classes
participate in mass ‘lo-hei’ session), IllumiNYte (night walk in school),
and the Civics Tutorial Orientation (during which the J2 class leaders
help induct their juniors into their newly formed J1 classes through games
and activities).</p>
<p>CLExco also empowers class leaders with leadership skills through thoughtfully
curated leadership training sessions, where class leaders are engaged and
taught skills to manage peers and foster stronger class bonds. These sessions
are organized twice yearly, namely the Class Leaders’ Camp and the end-of-year
Post-Camp Class Leader Training session.</p>
<p>CLExco members will also go on a retreat at the halfway point of their
term, to engage in reflection of their leadership experiences, build stronger
co-working relationships, and strategise for subsequent events.</p>
<p>A pre-requisite to be selected to join CLExco is to firstly be a class
leader (any position). During their leadership tenure, CLExco members also
receive multiple opportunities to hone their leadership skills (e.g. Leadership
Training Camp), learn the art of facilitation as well as the design and
execution of school wide events.</p>
