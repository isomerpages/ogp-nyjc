The Class Leaders Executive Committee, also known as CLExco, is made up of 12-14 class leaders, with a mission to organise college-wide events and initiatives with a class bonding focus.

Such events include the Chinese New Year celebrations (where classes participate in a class 'lo-hei' session), Sports Carnival (inter-class games), and the Civics Tutorial Orientation (during which the senior class leaders help the newly formed J1 classes break the ice with their new classmates through games and activities).

CLExco also aims to empower the class leaders by organising training sessions for them, and by engaging them to share and discuss ways of fostering stronger class bonds. These platforms are the Class Leaders' Camp and the end-of-year Post-Camp Class Leader trainings.

A pre-requisite to be selected to join CLExco is to be chosen as a class leader first. CLExco members receive, during their leadership stint, multiple opportunities to hone their leadership skills in event management, facilitation as well as the design and execution of training sessions for their peers. A CLExco retreat is also organised for the CLExco members at the halfway point of their term, to engage in reflection of their leadership experiences, build stronger co-working relationships, and strategise for their remaining term.
