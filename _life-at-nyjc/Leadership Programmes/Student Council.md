<p>The Nanyang Junior College Student Council serves as the main medium of
communication between the school management and the student body. It strives
to ensure that the voice of every NYJCian is heard and that their well-being
is prioritised. The Student Council also plays a key role in overseeing
various student activities and initiatives that serve the collective interests
of the school community. To achieve these objectives, the Student Council
is divided into three distinct committees: College Image and Bonding (CIB),
Student Affairs (SA) and Welfare (WELCO).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The seven-member&nbsp;<strong>Executive Committee</strong>&nbsp;forms
the policy-making and leadership core of the Council, comprising the President,
three Vice-Presidents, and the Heads of the three committees. The Executive
Committee ensures that all programmes and events helmed by the Student
Council align with the College’s mission and values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>College Image and Bonding Committee (CIB)</strong>&nbsp;promotes
school spirit and fosters connections within the college community. CIB
manages college publicity campaigns through the&nbsp;<em>heynanyang</em>&nbsp;Instagram
page and oversees college merchandise. They are also the proud caretakers
of Nyla, our beloved college mascot, who represents the vibrant and dynamic
spirit of NYJC. Whether it's posing for photos at events or spreading cheer
around campus, Nyla embodies the heart of our college spirit. The committee
also organises National School Games (NSG) cheering, a key highlight that
unites the NYJC family through shared moments of school spirit. Events
like Friendship Day further foster camaraderie among students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Student Affairs Committee (SA)</strong>&nbsp;acts as
a vital link between the school leaders and the student body. SA ensures
students’ voices are heard through&nbsp;regular&nbsp;feedback sessions
where NYJCians share suggestions to improve their school experience. The
committee also organises the annual Principal’s Dialogue, where students
engage with the&nbsp;school leaders&nbsp;to discuss pertinent issues affecting
the student body. Additionally, SA manages NYUtopia, the Student Lounge,
which offers recreational activities like foosball and board games as well
as NYArcade, an area featuring basketball machines and other leisure equipment
for students to unwind and recharge. SA is also responsible for managing
the school blazer and tie loaning system and handles BBQ pit bookings,
complete with charcoal and essentials to make it more convenient for NYJCians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Welfare Committee (WELCO)</strong>&nbsp;focuses on initiatives
that enhance the quality of life for all NYJCians.&nbsp;WELCO runs NYCares,
a welfare initiative that provides snacks and stationery to support students
and boost morale across the school year, especially in the lead-up to the
year-end examinations.&nbsp;For graduating students, WELCO runs J2 Well
Wishes, an initiative featuring graduation gifts with inspiring quotes
and a vibrant origami display in the atrium. The committee also leads Project
Appreciate, an annual effort to recognise and show gratitude to the college’s
Executive and Administrative Staff (EAS). Through meaningful interactions
and thoughtful gestures, WELCO celebrates the contributions of EAS, fostering
a deeper sense of connection and recognition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the three standing committees, major committees are formed
to plan and execute key college events such as J1 Orientation and the recruitment
of the next batch of councillors.&nbsp;Ad hoc committees are formed to
plan other specific, targeted college events, including&nbsp;<em>Teachers’ Day Celebrations</em>,
which honour and appreciate the contributions of the college’s staff;&nbsp;<em>Dinner &amp; Dance</em>,
which serves as a meaningful send-off for graduating students; and&nbsp;<em>The NYght</em>,
a showcase of talent where students take the stage to perform and compete.&nbsp;Each
councillor is involved in a main committee, an ad hoc committee, and a
major committee, ensuring a holistic experience in event planning and execution.</p>
