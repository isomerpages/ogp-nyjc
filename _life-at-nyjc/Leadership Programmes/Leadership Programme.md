<p><strong>Student Leadership Development Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Students with leadership potential are identified by their Civics Tutors
and CCA Teacher-Advisors. Selected students then undergo a differentiated
training programme that equips them with the skills and knowledge to carry
out their roles effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure this leadership development journey is coherent and well-supported
throughout the year, the Student Leadership Development Committee (SLD)
oversees the design and coordination of the programme, aligning training,
platforms for practice, and reflection so that students grow progressively
in confidence and impact.&nbsp;</p>
