**Student Leadership Development Programme**

Students with leadership potential are identified by their Civics Tutors and CCA Teacher-Advisors. The leaders are then put through a differentiated training programme that equips them with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their roles. An installation ceremony for the Class Leaders Executive Committee members and an investiture for the Student Councillors are conducted to endorse their leadership appointments. A 4-day Leadership Training Camp is conducted annually to prepare students for their roles.

Student leaders are empowered to sit in college committees and the student councillors meet with the College Steering Committee once a term to voice concerns and queries about college policies raised by the student body. This provides them with the opportunity to hone their leadership skills whilst at the same time build their confidence.
